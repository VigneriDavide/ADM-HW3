       "  'The Athenian Agora',\n",
       "  'Lying right beneath the northern slope of theAcropolis is the ancient Athenian Agora. Walking through the Agora takes the visitor back through the place where Athens’s mighty heart once beat.Literally meaning “marketplace,” the Agora was the economic center, where the wealth, reach and influence of classical Athens was visible by the wide range of goods shipped in from the nearby port of Piraeus, which ranged from wheat produced on the shores of the Black Sea to precious dyes from the Levant.But what marked the Agora with everlasting glory was the other commodity traded and peddled daily: ideas. The Agora was the meeting grounds and hang out spot for ancient Athenians, where members of the elected democracy assembled to discuss affairs of state, noblemen came to conduct business, ordinary citizens got together to meet up with friends and watch performers, and where the famed philosophers doused their listeners with wisdom (or rubbish).The Agora also played serious a role in religious festivals. The architectural layout of the Agora was centered around the Panathenaic Way, a road the ran through the heart of Athens to the main gate of the city, the Dipylon.The road was sacred, serving as the travel route for the Panathenaic festival, held in honor of the city’s patron goddess Athena every four years. The Agora was also home to the Temple of Hephaestus, the Greek god of craftsmen and metalworking. It was thought for many years to be a temple dedicated to Theseus, the founding mythological hero of Athens, but this turned out to be wrong. The temple is still visible in great condition, and is one of the best-preserved classical temples in all of Greece. Other temples formerly standing at the Agora include temples dedicated to Zeus, Athena, Apollo, and Ares.Notable buildings include the city’s arsenal, the Tholos (where the city’s elected generals lived on the public’s dime) and the numerous stoas- Stoa Baileios, Stoa Poikile, and the Stoa of Attalos to name a few.Stoas were massive covered porticos designed for public usage, where merchants could sell their goods and where people could catch some shade on a scorching summer day. The Stoa of Attalos was rebuilt in the 1950’s and houses both the Agora Museum and the storage and conservation facilities of the Agora’s ongoing archaeological excavation.Most of what’s visible and known of the Athenian Agora was a mystery until excavations by the American School in Athens began in 1934. Much of the site was actually covered by a refugee camp made up of Greeks who fled Turkey during the events following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.The excavations uncovered most of the 30+ known major buildings from the ancient Athenian Agora, along with thousands of artifacts. Conservation efforts have restored thousands of pieces of pottery and amphora (the standard storage vessel of the ancient world), studied thousands of marble statues and reliefs, and analyzed the remains of human and animal bones to give us a better understanding of what life was like in the ancient Athenian world.The excavation is ongoing, with a digging team made up of highly qualified students of classics, archaeology, and occasionally economics or oceanography present every summer to get their Indiana Jones on, most of which involves constant squatting in the hot Greek sun, pickaxing through layers of never-ending dirt, and sweeping all of the dirt and rocks away to reveal pottery, walls, bones, coins, but often…more dirt.In the summer of 2010, the excavation tackled the Stoa Poikile, or the Painted Stoa. It was the hang-out spot of people looking to relax and watch fire-eaters, as well as a testament to Athen’s glory days, housing four famous (but now lost) paintings known throughout the ancient world: a battle of Theseus against the Amazons, the siege of Troy, the Battle of Oenoe (Athen’s first major victory over Sparta), and the Battle of Marathon (Athen’s victory that stopped Persian the advancing Persian army). The Painted Stoa was also the meeting place of the philosopher Xeno and his students, and it is from this building that his disciples derived the name “Stoics.”Other sites to see in or around the Athenian Agora include the Church of the Holy Apostles (a Byzantine Church built around 1000 CE), the Roman Agora, the Areopagus (a hill where city affairs were managed prior to the democracy), the Pnyx (a hill where city affairs were managed once it became a democracy), the ancient cemetery at Keameikos, and of course the Acropolis.',\n",

       "  'This interactive space is dedicated to the work and legacy of Bob Moog and his groundbreaking Moog synthesizers.Robert Arthur Moog, better known as Bob, was an American engineer best known for his work with synthesizers and electronic music. Moog didn’t invent the synthesizer, but he did revolutionize it. Before Bob, synthesizers were huge, unwieldy machines that took up an entire room and cost far too much to make them commercially viable.Moog and his company Moog Music managed to radically change the nature of synthesizers, making them smaller, more affordable, and playable via a keyboard. And he later went on to create other now-fundamental synth concepts such as the pitch wheel, envelope generation, modularity, and voltage control.Moog began work on the Moog synthesizer in 1964, and it wasn’t long before it began having a profound effect on music. One of the first major albums to make use of the Moog was Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. by the Monkees, which topped the United States Billboard chart in 1967. Around the same time, the Moog synthesizer was appearing on albums by The Doors, The Rolling Stones, and The Byrds, and in 1968 hit the headlines on Wendy Carlos’ Grammy-winning album Switched-On Bach (Bach, but done with a Moog).In 2006, one year after Moog’s death, his family created the Bob Moog Foundation, the aim of which was to remember and carry forward his pioneering legacy, and to “ignite creativity at the intersection of music, science, history, and innovation.”The Moogseum, which opened in Moog’s adopted hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, on May 23, 2019 (on what would have been his 85th birthday), was part of this project. Here, Moog’s legacy is brought to life with a series of multi-sensory and interactive exhibits.The 1,400-square-foot museum features touchscreen kiosks containing hundreds of archival items detailing Moog’s life and work. Another exhibit tells the story of Leon Theremin, one of Moog’s influences, and lets visitors play a theremin (instructions included) while learning all about waveforms.In the “How Electricity Becomes Sound” immersive visualization dome, meanwhile, visitors can step inside a circuit board to learn how electricity is turned into sound. And then there’s a re-creation of Moog’s workbench, which includes prototype modules from the late-1960s.',\n",

       "  \"Diego Rivera's Detroit Industry\",\n",
       "  'In a city overflowing with street art, murals, and graffiti of all kinds, Diego Rivera’s controversial tribute to the Detroit automotive industry still reigns supreme.Commissioned in 1932 by Edsel Ford, son of Henry Ford and then president of Ford Motor Company, Rivera’s take on big-time American capitalism simultaneously glorifies the culture of the modern factory as well as slyly savaging the men in charge (his very patrons, in fact). The project was fraught with controversy from its inception, with critics from many sides intensively analyzing Rivera’s Marxist sensibilities before the project was even begun. Sure enough, Rivera crammed his mural with so many subversive easter eggs and subliminal jokes that various groups have sought to have the entire piece covered up, censored, or even destroyed entirely. It is a testament to Rivera’s artistry and wit that not only does the mural remain, it is now the crowning glory of the Detroit Institute of Arts, taking up all four walls of a courtyard in the center of the museum.Rivera was a master of the fresco, a type of mural in which paint is applied to wet plaster, allowing for bolder colors and more strongly defined forms. Rivera’s frescoes depicting Mexico are celebrations of the eternal connections between man and the land he inhabits, and depict agriculture as a source of identity and pride. Approaching the Detroit commission from the same socialist perspective, Rivera depicted the Ford River Rouge facility (then one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world) as an organic extension of the Detroit soil - mystical proto-human figures around the top part of the mural play with geometric shapes and scratch at the primordial soil, while below them, pistons and gears appear to grow downward like stalactites in a factory built inside a volcanic chamber. Elsewhere, masked doctors prod a haloed child with syringes in a kind of unsettling modern Nativity scene, and Henry Ford sits alone at his desk wearing a hard, and some might say weary, expression.The series of frescoes don’t seem to condemn the arch capitalist Fords outright, but neither do they celebrate them. Instead, they seem to suggest that modern industry is just as grand, bleak, and mystical as any human venture, including traditional Mexican agricultural methods. Nevertheless, the piece was hotly contested, with Detroit religious leaders demanding the piece be destroyed upon its unveiling. The museum weathered further complaints throughout the 30’s and 40’s, with one of Rivera’s other commissioned murals (in New York’s Rockefeller Center) actually being torn down for being too openly leftist in 1934. During McCarthy’s “Red Scare” of the 50’s, a sign was hung in front of the mural stating that Rivera, “detestable” communist though he may have been, was so impressed by Detroit’s industrial prowess that he painted the mural without individual ego, aiming simply to glorify the city’s achievements. Though this explanation is clearly false, it is certain that Rivera saw true creativity as well as hubris in scenes from America’s industrial heartland. The many natural motifs in the frescoes seem to hint that even the most gleaming factories are still bound to the soil they are built upon, a fact which has been proven frighteningly true in Detroit’s more recent past.',\n",

       "  'Old Charleston City Jail',\n",
       "  'Charleston, South Carolina’s old city jail has a long and haunting past that can still be explored today.The original structure was built in 1802 and served as the city jail from 1803 to 1939. The front interior of the jail still retains the original structure that was built in 1802, but the rest of the jail as it is today was built in 1855 when it was remodeled and the arched façade, towers, and octagon were added to give the jail an authentically imposing appearance.The jail housed a number of convicts ranging from murderers to petty criminals throughout its extensive history. Each floor of the jail kept a different type of inmate. The ground floor accommodated the jailers and the “gentleman” prisoners. The second floor held the minor criminals like debtors and prostitutes, and the third floor retained the hardened criminals such as murderers and thieves.While there is documented proof that a few of the more hardened offenders were hanged in the jail yard, many of the prisoners in the Charleston City Jail were petty criminals at best. Most prisoners died from natural causes or diseases at the jail, not from brutal torture or being hanged for their criminal offenses.During the Civil War, Union POWs were incarcerated inside the jail. There were hundreds of Union soldiers who passed through the jail, so many that the jail itself could not contain them and the majority of the Union POWs were forced to stay out in the jail yard in dilapidated tents.In 1886, a great earthquake rattled Charleston and although the jail survived, parts of the structure were severely damaged. A ventilation tower and the fourth floor of the jail were torn down, never to be replaced. The 20 foot wall that encircled the jail suffered so much damage that it was reduced down to 15 feet. A workhouse that had been built beside the jail did not survive the earthquake and had to be demolished.In 1911, a man by the name of Daniel Duncan, who was convicted of murder, was officially the last person hanged at the jail. The gallows were dismantled and removed, never to be used again. By the 1930s the jail was in its decline and the city of Charleston along with the Housing Authority, wanted to build new low income apartment buildings across the street from the jail.A playground was to be built inside the jail yard, so eleven more feet of the original wall was removed to allow more sunlight into the jail yard. The bricks that were removed from the wall were used to build the apartment buildings across from the jail. After 136 years as the Charleston City Jail, it was decommissioned and closed its doors on September 16, 1939.The jail sat abandoned and was only used for storage for the next 40 years before becoming a museum in the late 1970s. In the late 1990s, the Charleston Housing Authority sold the jail to what would eventually become the American College of the Building Arts. The school was not granted a license till 2004. The college now uses the jail as a learning tool while also renovating and restoring the historical structure.Update as of September 2022: The jail is closed indefinitely for renovations.',\n",

       "  'The Atlantic coast of South Carolina is home to a culture and language that has faded away in many places, but nevertheless continues to thrive far from mainstream American culture in both place and time.The Gullah people of South Carolina and Georgia are the descendants of enslaved people from West Africa who now live on the relatively remote islands that make up the states’ “Lowcountry” and ocean islands. The strip of islands between Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, are often referred to as the “Gullah Geechee Corridor.”Linguistic anthropologists have posited that “Gullah” is a mutation of “Angola,” while “Geechee” may refer to the Kissi people of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which provides some clues as to the exact origins of the Gullah. The Gullah people also have their own way of speaking, an English creole with many words and phrases adopted from a number of West African languages such as Yoruba, Wolof, and Fon. In the 16th and 17th centuries, enslaved people came from an extremely diverse mix of ethnicities and cultures, and the development of a creole language was essential for communication. Many believe that the Gullah language is the most accurate reflection of the vernacular used by enslaved people in America.Due to the relative remoteness of the coastal islands, Gullah language and cultural traditions have remained largely intact. Nowadays, the Gullah are quite happy to share their traditions and beliefs with the tourists who seek them out. Gullah Heritage Tours, a company operating on popular resort destination Hilton Head Island, offers a comprehensive tour of the Gullah Geechee Corridor, as visitors can travel through ten Gullah villages and learn of their history.These villages stand in stark contrast to tourist-oriented downtown Hilton Head. Most of the Gullah still live a somewhat old world lifestyle, with many continuing to sustain themselves with small personal farms.Visitors can also witness traditional Gullah ceremonies and listen to village storytellers. Near the starting point of the tour is the Coastal Discovery Museum, which also features Gullah presentations and performances year round. An annual Gullah culture festival is also held on Hilton Head Island in February.',\n",

       "  '“Decide your own life, don’t let another person run or rule you.” This is the first rule of the Hobo ethical code.In most people’s minds, hoboes are a thing of the past, frozen in time since the Depression. The hobo’s picturesque image, walking along rails with a light bindle stick, hopping steam trains from state to state to avert his fate, solidifies him as an iconic American figure.However, one might be surprised that “hoboes” don’t just belong to the past of the US. Small but dynamic communities mindful of preserving their history, their ethics, and their legacy exist today.Since 1974, three different generations composing the hobo community converge once a year in the city of Britt, Iowa to celebrate and exchange thoughts, tips, and stories about a penniless lifestyle. They gather to share tales of wandering around the country avoiding troubles and danger and preserve their self-taught train engineering and coded languages generated by decades of hoboes.With the goal of archiving and keeping alive their culture, the Hobo Foundation bought the Britt movie theater and installed a permanent display of artifacts donated by the itinerant workers: extensive memorabilia of such famous hoboes as Frisco Jack, Connecticut Slim, Hard Rock Kid, and Pennsylvania Kid, just to name a few. The foundation also hoststhe National Hobo Convention.On display are original hobo crafts, photographs, videos, and documentaries depicting the hobo lifestyle, paintings, a historic postcard collection, and a hobo doll collection. Visiting the Hobo Museum is a deep dive into the most Americana‑esque branch of vernacular archeology.',\n",

       "  'Dyckman Farmhouse',\n",
       "  'Built sometime around 1785, the Dyckman Farmhouse is a Dutch Colonial-style home that once stood on a 250-acre farm. Long since overrun by the booming city of New York, it now stands in a small park in the Inwood neighborhood of upper Manhattan. It’s both the oldest remaining farmhouse on the island, and the only one in the Dutch style.Now a museum, the Dyckman family home tells the story of rural Manhattan and the lifestyle of its early residents, as the island gradually changed from a farmland community to an ever-expanding urban metropolis.In the mid-1600s, Jan Dyckman made the long voyage from Westphalia to New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. Here he settled, built a farm and raised a family. By the time of the American Revolution, the family land had passed down to Jan’s grandson William. But when the British occupied Manhattan from 1776 to 1783, William Dyckman and his family fled to upstate New York.Upon their return after the war, the Dyckmans found their family home and orchards in ruins. William soon began to rebuild, however, albeit at a slightly different location on Kingsbridge Road (now Broadway). Less than five years later, the family and their enslaved workers had rebuilt the farmhouse, and rescued the orchards and 250 acres of land.William died in 1787, at which time the family put the property up for sale. But his son, Jacobus, decided to keep the farm, and moved in to the house around 1793. He had a large family, including his wife Hannah and their 11 children. But between 1809 and 1822, the Dyckmans were struck by one family tragedy after another, and Jacobus lost not only his wife but also four sons, a daughter, and a grandson.Jacobus continued on, growing crops such as corn, cucumbers, cabbage and hay, and filling his orchards with cherry and apple trees. He died in 1832 and the land passed on, eventually to his grandson Isaac Michael Dyckman, whose two daughters would be responsible for the preservation of the farmhouse in 1915. By this time, much of the land had been sold off or divided between various family members. And all the while, the city was creeping in.Rapid development in the area was quickly turning the land from rural to urban, and with it many of the old farmhouses were being demolished. Seeing their old home under threat, Mary Alice Dyckman Dean and Fannie Fredericka Dyckman Welch bought the property in 1915 specifically to save it from being swallowed up by the urban sprawl.Along with their husbands, they began a major restoration and furnishing project, striving to return the house to what they believed was its earliest appearance. In July 1916, the farmhouse was opened to visitors and has remained open ever since.',\n",

       "  'Hamilton Grange',\n",
       "  'Built in the pastoral expanses of colonial Harlem, Alexander Hamilton’stwo-story Federal-style family homewas completedin 1802, a scant two years before the Founding Father was shot by then-vice president Aaron Burr in the infamous Weehawken duel.Though more or less forgotten for a century, The Grange is currently experiencing a resurgence of visitors, owing in no small part to the explosive popularity of the musical Hamilton. It’seven adopted the phrase “It’s quiet uptown” from the showas thenew, unofficial slogan.The Grange—named after Hamilton’s grandfather’s estate in Scotland—remained with Hamilton’s wife, Eliza, after his death. Correspondence shows that she did not maintain the home as her primary residence for very long, however. By 1889, The Grange had been foreclosed and condemned, and was scheduled to be razed to make way for the ever-expanding Manhattan street grid, which was just startingto reach Harlem. Instead, St. Luke’s Episcopal Church purchased the home and moved it two blocks south, stripping the house of many features along the way, including replacing several picturesque windows with a makeshift door, allowing The Grange to conform to the newly laid out street patterns.Over the next 30 years, the house was mainly used for storage by the church. Two large buildings were eventually erected on either side of The Grange, one actually wrapping around the house, with the other flush against the side of it. In addition to effectively hiding The Grange, this also caused further damage to the historic home.In 1924, The American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society came to the rescue, buying the Grange and transforming it into a public museum, adding random Colonial furniture and artifacts from the Hamilton family. In 1960, the home was designated a National Historic Landmark and purchased by the National Park Service. The house was then restored to appear as Hamilton himself knew it, guided by what little correspondence and notes they had. Due to Hamilton’s unfortunately quick death and Eliza’s lack of description about the home in letters, there was no guidance on how to lay out the upper floor or basement.On May 9, 2006, the Hamilton Grange Memorial was moved, once again, to nearby St. Nicholas Park. The park was picked as it was within the boundaries of Hamilton’s original estate, would recreate the pastoral setting as best as modern-day New York City could, and would allow the exterior of the home to be restored to its original state.The Grange was lifted, in its entirety, 10feet off the ground on special rollers, and driven slowly down the street to the park. The two-block move took six hours, with many locals following and cheering the house on. Shortly thereafter, 13 sweet gum trees were planted outside the home, as Hamilton had originally done in honor of the original 13colonies.The Grange reopened to the general public on September 17, 2011. A vistors center, including a historical exhibit and gift shop, now takes up the basement, while the first floor is available for guided tours. The upper floors remain unrestored and closed to the public.',\n",

       "  'When Europeans began settling in the New World, billions ofpassenger pigeons flew in giant flocks up to a mile long, darkening the American sky with their passing. By 1914, they were all gone.Why this particularly plentiful type of wild pigeon barreled toward extinction in such an alarming plummet is no mystery. Simply put, the New World attracted Europeans, and the Europeans brought guns. While deforestation made its own dent in the pigeon population, hunting was the main source of their demise. Shot both for food and sport, the pigeons were picked off in astounding numbers, their largest decline taking place in the late 1800s. Up to a quarter of a million of the birds were reportedly shot in a single day in 1886.Starting in 1900, theAmerican Ornithologist’s Union, along with other conservationists, attempted to save the species, but it was too late. Few of the birds that were located and captured fared well in captivity, and those that survived were hard-pressed to reproduce. On September 1, 1914, the last known passenger pigeon passed away at her home in the Cincinnati Zoological Garden. Her name was Martha, and she was 29 years old.Named after Martha Washington, Martha the pigeon was hatched in captivity in 1885. Her attempts to breed were unsuccessful, and she was finally sent to retire peacefully in theCincinnati Zoo in 1902. By 1907, she was the only passenger pigeon left, which made her quite the zoo celebrity. Martha’s final years were spent basking in the glow of thousands of visitors.When Martha finally joined the rest of her pigeon people in the great big sky above the sky, the zoo leapt into action. Her corpse was quickly whisked away to theCincinnati Ice Company where she was frozen into a 300-lb. block of ice, and then it was off to the Smithsonian by express train. Once she arrived, she was skinned, stuffed, and her insides were dissected and then relocated to theNational Museum of Natural History.Martha has been on quite the display circuit since her demise. The little bird has been part of several different Smithsonian presentations, as well as making guest appearances (flown first class!) at theZoological Society of San Diego’s Golden Jubilee Conservation Conference, and theCincinnati Zoo’s dedication of the Passenger Pigeon Memorial. Once the Smithsonian retired its Birds of the World exhibit, Martha ended up in the archives, no longer viewable. However, the Cincinnati Zoo still remembers their sweet pigeon friend with a memorial statue and a mural that was commissioned for the 100th anniversary of her death.',\n",

       "  'It wasn’t long a go that a bladder stone was a life threatening affair.Among the historical figures who suffered from bladder stones were Napoleon Bonaparte, Peter the Great, Louis XIV, Oliver Cromwel, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, and famous diarist Samuel Pepys, who after surviving the operation to remove the stone - an operation that often killed those who underwent it - celebrated the occasion every year with a huge feast.Benjamin Franklin and his brother both suffered from the stones, and Franklin fashioned a silver catheter for himself to help relieve the pain. The power of one who could successfully remove the stone was great. It is believed that Frère Jacques Beaulieu - a famous French “lithotomist” or one who removed bladder stones - name lives on in the French children’s song “Frère Jacques.”That appreciation carried on into modern times. It was a a Gilded Age entrepreneur who funded the John Hopkins Brady Urological Institute after being successfully treated for bladder stones.Today bladder stones are treated regularly and with little fanfare. With new techniques, surgery isn’t necessary and the stones can be broken up with sound waves. The William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History located in the American Urological Association’s headquarters - still closely tied with the John Hopkins Brady Urological Institute - celebrates this and many other breakthroughs in urology.Started not by a doctor, but by William P. Didusch, a medical illustrator who focused in urology, the museum contains most of Didusch’s original drawings, as well as an impressive instrument collection, including hundreds of urological scopes, most important among them the collection of nearly 600 cystoscopes.The cystoscope, an instrument inserted into the urethra and used by urologists to see the inside of the bladder and urethra, was a revolution in urology. It allowed doctors to diagnose patients without performing surgery to see what the problem was. However, it is not without some sympathetic wincing that one views the older, and larger, of the cystoscopes.The museum also keeps a collection of urology-related historical medical texts, among them the pamphlet aptly named “Pisse-Prophet.”Besides the cystoscopes, among the most curious items in the urological collection are walking canes that held secret catheters, a collection of more than 30 microscopes dating back to the 1700s, and an enormous “pineapple sized” bladder stone.The museum has rotating exhibits which have included “Sexuality: Perception and Performance Throughout History” which displayed a jade phallus, anti-masturbation devices (a ring with spikes on the inside) and penile silicone implants from the 1980s, “Fad, Fraud, Future? Quackery and Nostrums in Urology” and “Remedies and Recipes” about historical treatments for urological ailments. Many of the items from past exhibits can still be seen on display.Viewing the collection is free but by appointment only. The “Sexual Perception and Performance” exhibit went up in 2006, but still appears to be available.Obscura Day location: April 9, 2011.',\n",

       "  'There are places where history takes longer to give way to the present. Sites where history’s heralds sing of the world before.Nowhere is this anachronistic choir heard more loudly than in Baldwin’s Book Barn. The structure containing today’s five-story Book Barn was built in 1822 and has exuded a timeless charm since, thanks toits cozy nooks, stone walls, wood-burning stove and seemingly never ending shelves of books, maps, and prints.While the view from the outside is pristine, the true magic of Baldwin’s Book Barn, is how upon being inside, one is given the feeling the the Barn is “dimensionally transcendental”, meaning that its exterior and interior exist in separate dimensions. In fact the magic of Baldwin’s Book Barn is well encapsulated in its similarities with Doctor Who’s Time Machine Spacecraft, the TARDIS, both of which appear to buck the traditional confines of time, while boasting an interior much larger than it appears from the outside.The Book Barn hides its seemingly endless archival treasure. Hidden within its meandering coves and staircases lie seemingly endless archival treasures lining every space within the Book Barn. Were its beams and masonry not exposed in spots, visitors would be forgiven for thinking the store simultaneously heldand literally wasbuilt from books. The books and staircases and rooms appear to wrap around and into each other forever, in a nebulous analog to the “enormous expanse of adjacent hexagonal rooms” described in Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges’s The Library of Babel.William and Lilla Baldwin first established their used book and collectible business in 1934 in nearby Wilmington, DE. In 1946 they moved to “The Barn”. The old milking house was converted into a residence for the Baldwin Family and the stone barn became the bookshop and, for some years, a country store museum. Baldwin’s Book Barn is located deep in the heart of the enchanting and historical Brandywine Valley, of Chester County, Pennsylvania. Chester County was one of the three original Pennsylvania counties created by William Penn in 1682, and was a center of naval shipbuilding. It was named for Chester, England. During the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Brandywine was fought at what is now the southeastern fringe of the county. The Valley Forge encampment was at the northeastern edge. Baldwin’s is an inveterate and unique institution, a hot spot for history’s erupting into the present.Baldwin’s Book Barn is one of America’s truly distinctive bookstores. Step inside and you are transported to another time and place; where history seems to whisper to you through the creaking windows and stairs of the barn. Today, Baldwin’s Book Barn is stuffed to the rafters with a treasure trove of 300,000 used and rare books, manuscripts, maps as well as fine paintings, prints, estate antiques, and other valued collectibles.',\n",

       "  'Little known to most tourists and even Germans, on the edgeof Berlin lie the chillingabandoned remains of “Hitler’s Olympic village,” built for the so-called Nazi Games of 1936. It illustrates both the technical foresight and the ideological absurdity of the Nazi regime.Germany won the bid to host the 1936 Summer Olympics two years before the Nazi Party came to power. Initially hesistant, Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler then saw this as an opportunity to spread Nazi propaganda and build up Germany’s military machine.Hitleroversaw the construction of the Olympic village in Wustermark, on the outskirtsof Berlin. In its heyday, the now-decaying complex included state-of-the-art dormitories, dining areas, training facilities, a swimming pool, and hosted some 4,000 athletes in luxury accommodations the likes of which had rarely been seen. Ironically, it was designed to portray an idyllic, picturesqueimage of a peaceful Germany to the world (the 1936 Games were the first to be televised). The Führer even named the complex the “village of peace,” with its layout resembling a traditional village and each hut named after a German town. However, the intention from the start was for the German army to use the complex once the Games were finished, and its design and construction were completely in the hands of the army.Hitler also tried to force anti-semitic politics on the event, lobbying to forbid Jews and black people from participating in the Games, though this hateful ployfailed as other nations threatened to boycott.In fact, despite this attempt to showcase the superiority of the Aryan race, the great American sprinter Jesse Owens won four gold medals that year. According to displays at the site, a fan wrote to Owens urging him not to accept the medal but the letter was intercepted by the Gestapo, who also listened-in on all telephone calls made by athletes from the village back to their home countries.During World War II, the Olympic complex was used as a hospital and training academy for German soldiers. In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet army and used as a barracks for almost 50 years until 1994, after the fall of communism. The Soviets repurposed the old swimming pool and training facilities for the likes of KGB interrogations, but also added sauna facilities to the swimming pool for their own soldiers. Where the village had once featured a mural of marching German soldiers, a painting of the Red Army was added, depicting Soviet soldiers planting the hammer-and-sickle flag on the German parliament.After the Soviets, the complex sat abandoned for years and fell into ruins. The old Olympic village was left largely untouched until around 2015, although vandalism and souvenir hunting destroyed most of the original artifacts. The site remained relatively unknown even to citizens in Germany. A few athletic tournaments have been held at the site and efforts are underway to restore some of the complex into a living museum albeit with limited funding. One room has been fully restored as a reconstruction of the room used by Jesse Owens; albeit in the Meissner house – next to the actual house where he stayed.As of summer 2019, the western half of the crumbling complex is being developed into townhouses and apartments as Berlin’s population booms—including gutting of the original dining hall and conversion into residential apartments.',\n",

The animator was the gifted Terry Gilliam and the show was the epic comedy series Monty Python’s Flying Circus.If you look carefully at the bottom lefthand corner of the painting, you may notice that Cupid’s foot is the emblematic Monty Python foot—you know, the giant foot that randomly stamps down from the heavens obliterating objects beneath it.You may recognize the foot from theFlying Circus’s animated titlesequence: At the end of the opening, the giant foot descendsand crushes the title. The foot became atrademark icon forthe Monty Python comedy troupe.It was here in the National Gallery that Gilliam saw the wonderful, huge Bronzino painting and borrowed Cupid’s foot for TV. Indeed, this is somethingGilliam did quite frequently.Monty Python’s Flying Circuswas written and performed by five Englishmen while Gilliam, the lone American living abroad, was the sole creator of the show’s surrealand wonderful animation (although he occasionally pops up in sketches, too). His collage-like animations combined borrowedbits and pieces of famous paintings and photography.Decontextualizing the images and juxtaposing them with other absurditiesworked perfectly with the show’s humor and doubled as a commentary on classical art.

       "  'Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama',\n",
       "  'In the 1880s, “The Battle of Atlanta” cyclorama painting was an immersive experience—the equivalent of virtual reality today. The painting is a full-color, three-dimensional illusion designed to transport the viewer onto the battlefield. Cycloramas were created as a form of entertainment—they were the IMAX of their time. The painting was a visual story about the 1864 Battle of Atlanta, but over time it has evolved into a significant artifact that has its own fascinating story. Now, the historical journey of the painting itself is part of the big picture.With a circumference of 358 feet and a surface area of 15,030 square feet, the Atlanta Cyclorama is considered to be the largest oil painting in the world. It stands 49 feet tall and weighs more than 10,000 pounds. In the 1930s, the considerable effect of the painting was enhanced with the addition of three-dimensional characters and objects. Eagle-eyed visitors can spot the likeness of Clark Gable standing in for a fallen soldier.“The Battle of Atlanta” took five months to create.It was made at the American Panorama Company in Milwaukee  by 17 German artists, and debuted in Minneapolis in 1886. Painted 22 years after the Battle of Atlanta, the painting originally depicted the battle as a heroic Union victory so it would appeal to Northern audiences. When the painting relocated to Atlanta in 1892, it was slightly modified and advertised as “the only Confederate victory ever painted” to appeal to its new Southern audiences that maintained Confederate sympathies. The 1864 Battle of Atlanta was not a Confederate victory, and most of the changes were reversed in the 1930s.The cyclorama is a relic of a past form of entertainment. Although once enormously popular, only three significant cycloramas remain in the United States: The Atlanta Cyclorama, the Gettysburg Cyclorama and the Panorama of Versailles on display the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In California, the petite Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles is a modern recreation of the art.Although few full-scale panoramas of the hundreds that once lured crowds around the world still exist, there are a few notable survivors: In Wroclaw, Poland, the enormous 120-year-old Raclawice Panorama lets you step into the middle of the 1794 Battle of Racławice. In Istanbul, Turkey the Panorama 1453 Museum recreates the epic fall of Constantinople. A more modern example in Damascus, Syria the October War Panorama is dedicated to scenes from the 1973 October War between Israel, Egypt, and Syria.In 2014, plans were announced to close the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War History Museum.On February22, 2019, AtlantaHistory Center opened an exhibit calledCyclorama: The Big Picture, which features thefully restored Battle of Atlantapainting. At the centerpiece is this 132-year-old hand-painted work of art.Guests enter the painting rotunda through a seven-foot-tall tunnel entry—passing underneath the diorama—before ascending an escalator to the 15-foot-tall stationary viewing platform. Here, visitors get a full 360-degree view of the painting, enhanced by technology and a 12-minute theatrical, larger-than-life presentation projected onto the painting.The museum uses the cyclorama, as a tool to teach about history and culture, and how interpretations change over time. The work has been praised as a piece of southern heritage and criticized as an anachronism meant to glorify the Confederacy.',\n",

       "  'Just off the side of the highway in St. Charles, Missouri, is an odd white stone mound that hidesa hermetically sealed vault full of the toxic byproducts of midcentury American weapon production.One morning in late 1940, every household in the small Missouri towns of Howell, Hamburg, and Toonerville awoke to a letter from the United States War Department. All the letters bore the same message: residents had less than 45 days to pack their things and leave. Land was sold and buildings torched as 576 people made way for the largest explosives plant in the United States. From 1941—1945, theWeldon Spring Ordnance Works produced over 750,000,000 pounds of TNT and DNT for the allied war effort. After World War II ended, workers began burning contaminated factory buildings, initiating an extended legacy of mismanaged toxicity.As Cold War tensions escalated in the 1950s, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission began using the land for uranium processing. Radioactive waste products from the plant were all dumped in a nearby limestone quarry.By the time the factory closed in 1966,the quarry had become a vast cesspool of poisonous materials. Over the next 20 years, the area in what is now St. Charles Countywas an abandoned hellscape of toxic pits and blown-up buildings. Amid the asbestos and the sludge, thousands of unlabeled chemical drums stood as ghostly markers of the country’s nuclear ambitions.The EPA declared Weldon Spring a superfund site in the late 1980s, triggering amassive cleanup effort — the borders of the area were not far from local drinking wells. By 2002, the U.S. Department of Energy had siloed over 1.48 million cubic yardsof toxic waste into a single holding cell. Within a larger network of parks and biking trails, the white fortress is now the single monument to the region’s messy history. Visitors can climb to the summit of thesteep tomb, which is 75 feet high. In what is otherwise an extraordinarily flat county, Weldon Spring provides an impressive view in all directions.No need to rush toenjoy it — this strange coffin is built to quarantine its troublesome insidesfor the next 1,000 years.Once you return to reality, a modest museum explains the herculean labor of containment that was required.',\n",

       "  'While not technically a serial killer, the terror Ed Gein wrought throughout the Plainfield, Wisconsin, area has been fodder for American nightmares ever since.Upon his capture by authorities for the murder of two women, Gein admitted to a whole slew of unimaginable practices committed after digging up the graves of recently deceased middle-aged women whom he thought bore a resemblance to his beloved dead mother. Found in his shed were keepsakes and personal ornamentation Gein had fashioned from the bodies of his victims, including death masks, lampshades of stretched human skin, salted genitalia in a box, a “woman suit” which Gain donned when pretending to be female, and an “armchair” constructed out of actual human arms.Given the aforementioned horrors, it’s easy to see how this one real man could have influenced some of cinema’s most recognizable mad men. Norman Bates (Psycho) inherited Gein’s mommy-complex, Leatherface (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) eponymously references Gein’s death mask obsession, whereas the cannibalistic Buffalo Bill appears among the serial killers portrayed in Oscar-winning The Silence of the Lambs.After his arrest, he was immediately deemed mentally insane to a degree that prevented his trial for decades. When he finally did face a jury, it took them only one week to convict him, ensuring his incarceration in various state mental institutions until his death in 1984.Gein’s body was laid to rest in the Gein family plot only a few meters from the original burial sites of some of the corpses he’d previously exhumed. Visitors had taken to chipping off pieces of his headstone until the entire slab was stolen in 2000. A year later, the tombstone was found thousands of miles away in Seattle, and returned to Wisconsin, though it presently resides in a Waupaca museum for safe keeping. His burial is currently marked by flowers, flanked on either side by the graves of his mother and brother.For the morbidly fanatical, the Gein family land can still be located in Plainfield, though none of the buildings remain after an act of arson – occasionally attributed to Plainfield’s authorities – leveled “the place of evil,” effectively preventing the farm from becoming another morally dubious tourist attraction.',\n",

       "  'Despite France’s crucial role in helping Americawin independence from Britain during the Revolutionary War, the newly born United States did not return the favor when France’s own political revolution sprang up a decade later. A few influential Pennsylvanians, however, did throwa small bone to the French upper crust.In the late 18th century, several wealthy Pennsylvania politicians and businessmen expressed sympathies with exiles of the French Revolution, and built a small settlement for aristocratic refugees fleeing the war.Loyalists of King Louis XVI were hoping to escape the guillotine following the king’s execution in 1793, and French exiles were also fleeing the French colony of Saint-Domingue in Haiti, where slave uprisings had broken out in 1791.The Pennsylvania men, whoincludedStephen Girard, Robert Morris and John Nicholson, saw a lucrative opportunity in the refugees’ displacement, and purchased a 300-acre plot of land in Bradford County, near a river bend of the Susquehanna. The intention was to create a small slice of France for French asylum-seekers, with the hope that it would become a self-sufficient community.On this plot of land by the Susquehanna river,the quasi court once entertained princes and future kings — it’srumored the settlement even included a house for Queen Marie Antoinette.The plot was laid out to look like a town, with a market square, a grid of broad streets and 413 lots for houses. About 30 long houses were built from logs. Although crude, most of these houses had a chimney, wallpaper, glass windows, shutters and porches.Around 30 refugees arrived at French Azilum in the fall of 1793. La Grande Maison, the grandest log structurein the settlement, was used for social gatherings and entertaining distinguished guests, such as Talleyrand and Louis Philippe, the future king of France. Rumors flew that the house was intended to be the home of Marie Antoinette and her children, should they manage to escape from France.However theattempt to create an insular version of the French good life did not last long.Morris and Nicholson went bankrupt in the late 1790s, and money from French sources dried up. Many of the exiles left for southern American cities like New Orleans, Savannah and Charleston.In 1803, Napoleon allowed the exiles to return to France, and the little sliver of France had all but disappeared by the turn of thecentury. Some families chose to remain in Pennsylvania, and settled in local communities: theLaPortes, Homets, LeFevres, Brevosts and D’Autremonts.Today, none of the more than fifty original structures of French Azilum remain.The historic site retainedsome 20 acres of the original settlement, though most of the land was absorbed into local farmland. There is one reconstructed log cabin that serves as a museum, which displays artifacts and objects that belonged to the town’s original French exiles.',\n",

Most of the murals also have some sort of intentional fault in them to try to spot, making a game of what began as one artist’s actual mistake that then became a theme across all of the town’s murals.Reader’s Digest once dubbed Lake Placid “America’s Most Interesting Town,” and while it may not be the most fascinating town in the nation by some standards, it’s a town of pleasant, inoffensive diversions if you’re in the area, and definitely a must-see if you’re touring the so-called Florida Mural Trail, a collection of cities with outdoor murals, mostly across the southern half of the Sunshine State.Some of Lake Placid’s murals are also advertised as having audio to accompany the graphics, though as of October 2018, only one of the murals with sound was operable. (It’s the one featuring the Florida black bear that sort of growls when you walk close enough to activate the motion sensor.)If you’re into colorful leafy plants in addition to colorful public art, you’re in luck here.

       "  'Women pilots had been barred from participating in the celebrated Cleveland Air Race, so in 1929 they decided to start their own. The Air Race Classic was instantly met with public criticism, with the women almost being forced to each fly with a man, but they refused to race under such conditions.Despite the obstacles, 20 women pilots started the 2,700 mile race from Santa Monica, California, and, with Will Rogers serving as starter, raced to Cleveland, Ohio. The racers included Amelia Earhart and film pilot Ruth Elder as well as women who had been drawn to the rare opportunity in a heavily male world of aviation.Some pilots soon faced problems, including from suspected sabotage, and one pilot caught typhoid fever. Another had a fatal crash. Yet 14 finished, an impressive number for any long distance air race in the early days of flight. Following the race, the women reconvened in November of that year and decided to start the first women pilots organization. They sent letters to each of the 117 women pilots in the country and heard back from 99. Thus the Ninety-Nines International Organization of Women Pilots was formed.Their headquarters is now in Oklahoma City near, coincidentally, the Will Rogers World Airport, and on their second floor is a museum dedicated to women pilots. There are displays on Harriet Quimby, the first woman to get a pilot’s license in the United States; Bessie Coleman, the first African American female pilot; Tiny Broadwick, the first woman to jump with a parachute from a hot air balloon; Bassica Raiche, who built her first biplane in her living room; early German aviatrix Melli Beese; and women in the space program like Sally Ride.There are also numerous personal objects belonging to Amelia Earhart, who was the first president of the Ninety-Nines.

Over time, his firm became known for churning out postcards in the “Greetings From” style, which silhouetted a city’s distinctive architectural features in letters that spelled out its name.Souvenir postcards caught on at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition, where there was plenty to write home about. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Congress passed a series of acts clarifying exactly what could be sent through the mail. By 1907, they’d approved privately printed cards with divided backs—one side for the address, the other for a message—and images on the front. Flurries of postcards started flying. According to post office estimates, 700 million of the cards were mailed between June 1907 and June 1908. As people hit the road for adventures, they wanted to take friends and family along with them, or at least jot off a note to fill them in on what they missed.Teich’s company shuttered in 1978, and its extensive archives lived in theLake County Discovery Museum in Wauconda, Illinois, for many years before landing at the Newberry in 2016.The Curt Teich Postcard Archives Collection contains more than 2.5 million objects. These span the 19th and 20th centuries, and depict some of the major forces that were shaping America, among them, highways, cities, amusements, and fairs and expos that were obsessed with visions of the future. It’s also rich with images of public works projects—those water treatment facilities and other plants that might not have been tourist destinations, but kept a city running.Any visitor aged 14 or older can apply for a readers’ card and view the collection in person. In the meantime, before you set foot in the library, you can send a digital postcard from the archives, no postage necessary.

After rooting through the massive machine to find the cause of the problem, Admiral Grace Hopper, who worked in the Navy’s engineering program at Harvard, foundthe bug. It was an actual insect.The incident is recorded in Hopper’s logbook alongside the offending moth, taped to the logbook page: “15:45Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay. First actual case of bug being found.”Grace Hopper had beena keen mathematician her entire life, but it wasn’t until sheenlisted in the Navy during WWII that she got a chance to unleash her skills. Originally turned away from the Women’s Naval Reserves because at 34 she was considered too old and too small, Hopper persisted and eventually came to work at Harvard. She was one of the top minds in computer science, pioneering early compilers that translatedprogramming code into machine code, not to mention the fact that she became the Navy’s first female admiral.The “bug”and the page it’s attached to reside at the Smithsonian’s Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

It winds through the breathtaking redwoods that earned this area its name, and it’s appropriately named the “Trail of Tall Tales.” It features chainsaw sculptures made of mythical loggers and forest creatures like gnomes and elves.The attraction also features a forest canopy walk with two platforms and eight bridges strung among the trees. You can also take the SkyTrail gondola 1,500 feet up to the top of the forest.Part of this trail is dedicated to the mythology, rumors and exaggerated stories about Paul Bunyan and his blue ox as well as the other loggers and lumberjacks in the area at the turn of the century. There is also a gondola ride that will glide you through the towering trees to a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean, and a gift shop that is full of everything from your typical tourist fare of cheesy mugs and magnets to baby redwood trees that you can plant in your own yard.The gift shop also houses a lovely local fudge shop as well as the “End of the Trail Museum,” which features one of the largest privately owned exhibits of Native American history in the state.Some call the Trees of Mystery a tourist trap, but it is a wonderful one that has managed to thrive for over 50 years now, thanks in large part (literally) to the giant statues who inspire curiosity and photo opportunities for anyone who happens by.Just don’t try to park under them – and once your pictures are done, it’s best to head into the shop or the trails. In 2007, Babe the Ox’s 1000-pound, 9-ft. wide head fell off and crashed to the ground below. The accidental decapitation was a result of rotted materials and years and years of rain damage.

Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, is only one of many attractions in Flushing Meadows, a huge public park built for the 1939 World’s Fair.Developer and urban planner Robert Moses oversaw the creation of the 897-acre park on a dumping grounds in Queens—labeled by F. Scott Fitzgerald in TheGreat Gatsby as the “valley of ashes.” In preparation for the 1939 World’s Fair, the first of its kinds to use “the future” as its theme, dozens of buildings and structures were erected, many of them experimental in design.In 1964, the park hosted another World’s Fair. As was the case after the ‘39 exposition, many of the structures were dismantled when the fair closed (several rides and attractions, including It’s a Small World, ended up at Disneyland) , but the New York State Pavilion is still here, an unused and vacant reminder of the futurist architectural style that dominated the fair. The flying saucer-shaped Pavilion, with its trio of observation towers hovering above, is one of the most iconic images of the parkAnother famous icon ofFlushing Meadows-Corona Park is the Unisphere, a “12-story high, spherical stainless steel representation of the Earth,” the world’s largest globe structure. Three metal loops encircle the giant globe representing the paths of “Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Telstar, the first active communications satellite.” It was designated a New York City landmark in 1995.The Panorama of the City of New York,an amazingly accurate scale model of the city, was one of the most popular attractions of the 1964 World’s Fair. After a refurbishing in the early 90s, the model was updated to include every New York City building constructed before 1992. Today, the Panorama is on display at the park’s Queens Museum.Although the World’s Fairs have long ago come and gone, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is still a vibrant urban oasis for the local community. Besides Citi Field and the Queens Museum, the park is home to the USTA National Tennis Center, which hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament, the New York Hall of Science, the Queens Zoo, and more.',\n",

In that first scene, a spirited young woman declares that she will educate herself, find a wealthy husband, and get out of her dreary mining town. She does. And so did Margaret Brown.Margaret Tobinwas born in the small town of Hannibal, Missouri. The wealthy husband she found was J.J. Brown, a man 12 years her senior who struck it big in the Colorado mining scene. He built Margaret this beautiful home in Denver, where she quickly stood out in Denver’s polite society: a bright, principled, and entirely unapologetic young woman. Although her rough edges ruffled some feathers, she was certainly the kind of person who you would want by your side in a crisis. She would prove her mettle during the most most storied tragedy of her time, the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Margaret was traveling alone in a first class cabin on the Titanic’s maiden voyage. When it became apparent that all was lost, she jumped into action. She helped the crew load up the lifeboats before she was finally persuaded to enter one herself. Once at sea, she insisted that the boat turn back to look for survivors, against the protestations of Quartermaster Robert Hitchens. For her heroism, her fellow lifeboat passengers christened her “The Unsinkable,” a moniker that stuck and made her one of the Titanic’s most famous survivors.Even if theTitanic had safely arrived at port,Margaret Brown would still have earned a place in the history books. She lived the entirety of her life without ever losing her element of surprise or her moral backbone. The reason she was on the Titanic in the first place was that she was traveling home from Egypt, where she—the girl from Hannibal, Missouri—had been touring. In 1914, when the Colorado National Guard attacked protesting miners during the so-called “Ludlow Massacre,” Margaret Brown led the relief efforts for the workers’ families. After World War I, she helped the American Committee for Devastated France provide medical care and rebuild ravaged villages—work thatearned her the Légion d’Honneur. She worked for historical preservation, for children’s literacy, and for countless other causes. And at the end of her remarkable life, she was working on something new entirely: a career as an actress.Although we may never again see her equal, we may see her home. The Molly Brown House was slated to be demolished in 1970, but was saved by a local preservation group. It now operates as a museum and community center.',\n",

A young pharmacist-in-training at Tassel Pharmacy, Strickler enjoyed inventing new sundaes, which were popular among the studentsfrom nearby St. Vincent College.Hispièce de résistancewas three scoops of ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate) nestled between a banana sliced lengthwise and topped with pineapple, chocolate and strawberry sauces, whipped cream, chopped nuts, and a maraschino cherry. The banana split, as it came to be known, cost 10 cents—double the price ofthe pharmacy’s other sundaes.The popularity of the banana split spread like wildfire, and other pharmacies have laid claim to its invention over the years. However, records indicate that Strickler was the first to create the classic dessert.The National Association of Ice Cream Retailers acknowledged Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split in 2004, and in2013 the Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission placed a plaque at the former site of Strickler’s pharmacy. It was joined by a gigantic banana split statue a few years later, which marks the center of activities during Latrobe’s annual Great American Banana Split Celebration.',\n",

       "  'According to the French government and California’s Imperial County, the official center of the world lies in the town of Felicity in California’s Sonora Desert. There is no scientific or political reason for the designation, but only the effort of Jacques-André Istel and his wife Felicity Lee (the town’s namesake), who founded the town in 1986.Jacques-André made his name and fortune as a famous French-American parachutist and co-founder of Parachutes, Inc., which produced parachuting equipment and opened the first parachuting school in the United States. He is credited as a key figure in popularizing parachuting in America and has been referred to as the “father of American skydiving.” In 1985 he wrote the children’s book “Coe: The Good Dragon at the Center of the World” about a dragon that lived at the center of the world, which served as the inspiration behind the town’s creation.After Istel was unanimously voted mayor, in a 3-0 vote, he erected a pyramid to mark the exact spot of the world’s “center.” Over the last 25-years, Istel added many sights to his town, including a beautiful traditional-style church on a man-made hillside (modeled after a church in Brittany), a lone outdoor 25-foot staircase that was formerly part of the Eiffel Tower, a checkered field of flowers, and a 15-foot bronze sundial that incorporates Michelangelo’s Arm of God. The most ambitious of his additions is the Museum of History in Granite, World Heritage Site candidate (“Design worth the trip” TIME magazine), which currently consists of 18 one-hundred foot triangle-shaped granite monuments, meant to “engrave in granite highlights of the collective memory of humanity.” The completed subjects so far include “The History of Arizona”, “The History of California”, “The History of the United States”, “The United States Marine Corps Korean War Memorial” (in which Istel served), “The History of French Aviation”, and “The History of the French Foreign Legion”. The eight monument “History of Humanity” is built but only 30% engraved to date. Two new monuments will have “Animals of the World”.Visitors to the site between Thanksgiving and Easter will receive a 15 minute tour and signed certificate declaring that they have been to “the center of the world.”',\n",

       "  'Most visitors to Bowling Green today come to see Arturo Di Modica’s imposing Charging Bull sculpture. Butunnoticedin the background of their photographs isone of New York Cities most enduring and historically important landmarks: its oldest fence. Made of wrought iron, the historic barrier was installed around Bowling Green in 1771.The history of Bowling Green itself goes back to the beginnings of the New Amsterdam colony. Situated across from the original Dutch fort it was originally used as a cattle market and parade ground, it was locatedat the foot of the old American Indian path which would eventually become Broadway. On March 12th, 1773 the market place was leased to three gentleman landowners for a sum of one peppercorn a year, and the ground was turned into New York’s first public park. Named Bowling Green for the sporting arena that it contained, it was designed for the “beauty and ornament…as well as for the Recreation and Delight of the inhabitants of this city.”But the idyllic tranquility of Bowling Green would turn to mob violence in 1776. Six years earlier the British government had installed a giant statue of King George III. Weighing over 4,000 pounds it was built to celebrate the victory over the French in the Seven Years War. As relations between Britain and her colonies steadily deteriorated the statue became a focal point for anti-English protests. To combat the increasing threat of vandalism a wrought iron fence was installed to protect the monarch in 1771. On July 9th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read out to Washington’s troops stationed by City Hall. A mob from the Sons of Liberty rushed to Bowling Green and immediately attacked and toppled the statue of George III. Legend has it that the statue was shipped up to a foundry in Connecticut where the likeness of George III was turned into musket balls to be used against his red-coated army. Partial remains of the statue can still be found in the Museum of the City of New York.Today Bowling Green still holds its place in history as the first public park in the City. Where once King George III looked up towards Broadway as his subjects played the gentle game of Crown Bowls in the park, there is now a fountain. Surrounded by the imposing buildings of the Alexander Hamilton customs house, the old Standard Oil headquarters and the shipping offices of Cunard and the Panama-Pacific Ocean liners, it’s a popular spot for tourists. New York’s oldest fence which once protected a king is still there though, and on closer inspection still bears the scars of that day of violence in 1776. See the fence posts were oncedecorated with royal crowns but on July 9th, the Sons of Liberty cut them off and the saw marks are still visible today.',\n",

Jessee to build the slinky, displayed in VHS’s lobby, out of medium-density fibreboard, a compressed wood product that actually keeps the sculpture relatively light at 150 pounds. Jessee is based in Ashland where he owns MCS Design and Production, a company that builds anything from props for television and films to sculptures for corporate and residential places.Jessee also built the 18-foot-tall, 300-pound Gumby looking out from the front steps of the building.The previous, and also unofficial, record holder is two-feet taller, but only half as long. It’s in Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the toy, and unlike Jessee’s helical spring behemoth, doesn’t have the bragging rights to being functional.Update May 2018.

       "  'There is a cave near Fallon, Nevada that’s basically agarage. A 3,500 yearold garage thatstored tools, spears, baskets, and fishing gear, and other stuff for millennia.Aptly called Hidden Cave, the site is protected under the watchful eye of the Bureau of Land Management, and has a number of museums, universities and archaeologists looking after it too. Since 1972 the cave has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it was uncovered 45 years earlier by a tried and true method of discovery—four kids out looking for treasure.As far back as the late 19thcentury, rumors had swirled around Fallon that there was secret bandit treasure to be found in a cave. Since no one knew what cave, four local boys, determined to find it, scoured the rocky hillsides. They stumbled onto what would later be called Hidden Cave, but found no bandit booty. Still, word of the cave and its contents slowly got around, finally reaching the ears of a local archaeologist, Margaret Wheat, who organized the first excursion to the cave in 1935.At the time, Hidden Cave was so packed with silt and dust and bat guano that it was difficult to get a sense of just how jammed it was with a valuable record of ancient Native American hunter-gatherers. It took a few years before there was a major attempt to cut through the layers, but in the 1940s and 1950s, and again in the late 1970s, teams of archaeologists and students did the dirty work, and began documenting and cataloging that record.Hidden Cave was never used for shelter—even thousands of years ago it was way too dark, dusty and cramped to live in—but for hundreds of years it was used by the earliest Native Americans in the area, from at least 1800 B.C. to about 1500 B.C. as mini storage.What is now the arid Nevada desert was then a vast area of marshland, and nomadic tribes, making use of the natural resources, needed a safe place to stash their gear as they were on the move. Hidden Cave was used as a kind of combined tool shed, pantry and safe deposit box, its entry so well hidden that things could be left behind, undisturbed. Thousands of artifacts, spread out over diverse caches, have been found and identified through the combined efforts of archeologists and members of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone tribe.After the last major excavation in the late 1970s the cave was opened to the public, remaining staged for researchers and visitors of all kinds to see firsthand the discoveries of previous excavations. It’s a glimpse into the painstaking and back-breaking work, vital to cataloging such a rich and remarkable site.',\n",

Ehn filled it with western memorabilia, weapons and pelts that represented his earlier vocation, hoping to attract tourists with a slick gimmick. When his gimmick failed to bring in the desired amount of business, John Ehn decided to go big.Local legend has it that he decided giant statues were the way to go, and hired sculptor Claude Bell of Cabazon Dinosaur and Knott’s Berry Farm fame to make him a few. After observing Bell’s technique for a few days, he decided it wasn’t rocket science and he could easily finish the job himself. For the next 30 years, Ehn filled the property with crudely-made cowboys, Native Americans, miners, saloon girls and an entire cemetery scene depicting his version of a “Boot Hill”.In 1985 the land was sold, and the statues were eventually relocated to Pierce College, where anonymous “mystery” volunteers touch up paint and keep the rustic location accessible by clearing brush and keeping the trail clear for visitors.Update as of May 2021: The statues are currently surrounded by a fence and can not be visited.Update as of April 2022: Some items were removed, with a handful of pieces being relocated to Valley Relics Museum.',\n",

In 1942, the American shipbuilder Henry Kaiser took on this necessary innovation by looking to the skies. Kaiser recruited Howard Hughes, a pilot, engineer, filmmaker, and millionaire to help design a flying boat that could airlift the cargo.Given the government restrictions on building materials during wartime, Hughes had to be resourceful, yet he was able to build an aircraft six times larger than any aircraft of its time without the use of aluminum or steel. To Hughes’ dismay, the press continued to call it the “Spruce Goose” even though the wooden mammoth is mostly made of birch. (The “Birch Bird” really is almost just as good.) As Hughes was a notorious perfectionist, the engineering feat was stillunfinished by the end of the war. Kaiser dropped out of the costly project, but Hughes continued to slave over his creation, egged on by his pride and the press. Many believed the plane would never fly.  On November 2nd, 1947, during a taxi test off the coast of California, Hughes impulsively piloted his Herculean airboat. It flew for about a mile, only hovering 70 feet above the water, but it still flew. The plane was never airborne again. Today, the Spruce Goose can be visited at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. There it stands as the centerpiece of the museum, a wonder of innovation, aviation, and pride. ',\n",

The institution specializes in Victorian era timekeeping devices, but sports an eclectic mixture of timepieces from around the world. But it was the 19th century that brought us the grandiosely-named “The Eighth Wonder of the World,” a mammoth clock at the museum whose elaborate inner-workings inspired at least one man to offer $50,000 to anyone who could craft a machine that could outdo it.The 11-foot-tall contraption, completed in the 1870s by Pennsylvanian Stephen D. Engle, features a curious collection of figures drawn from mythology, the Bible, and the American Revolutionary War. He even included a figure resembling himself to the group. The clockmaker reportedly labored twenty years on his brainchild.The clock’s mechanisms are spellbinding. Over the course of an hour, 48 figures, including Jesus, Satan, Father Time, Molly Pitcher, and Orpheus appear at intervals.What’s more, the clock indicates positions of the sun, constellations, and the zodiac. And as if that weren’t enough, Engle’s lavish creation blasts hymns and patriotic music through its own organ and marks the days of the week, month, the tides, and the phases of the moon.A contemporary of Engle’s named Jacob Reid held that the clock was a supreme achievement that could not be topped. He wagered $50,000 that no one could create a more elaborate clock.In its time, the clock was showcased around the nation, but went missing in the ‘50s until it was recovered in 1983 in upstate New York.

Watching them all quietly is their oldest resident: Mr. Banff, the Merman.Little is known about the specific history of this mysterious half-fish, half terrifying taxidermy experiment, but it was most likely acquired by the shop’s legendary proprietor Norman Luxton around 1915. Following adventures as a gold prospector and an ill-fated attempt on an around-the-world canoe expedition (he was lucky to survive), Luxton returned to Banff where he became a successful entrepreneur, a newspaperman, and an honorary chief of the Stoney Native American tribe. In addition to the Trading Post, Luxton founded theBuffalo Nations Luxton Museum, and today his former home is preserved as a museum.Conflicting stories of the merman’s origin pit the idea of Luxton purchasing the gaff from a mysterious Javanese salesman against the legend of Luxton building the beast himself.Mummified mermaids have a long history, with some dating back centuries, but they really hit their stride as part of the sideshow circuit when P.T. Barnum got into the action with an elaborately planned hoax in 1845. Supposedly caught in the waters of Fiji by a sailor, the so-called “Feejee Mermaid” was actually a taxidermy gaff of a monkey sewn to a fish, and detailed in papier-mache… and that lucky sailor was none other than Barnum’s accomplice.

The super secret recipe which famously contains more than 40 different herbs was passed through the family line, becoming an unofficialnational drink. Even when the family was exiled under Communist rule, the recipe was given to a confidant so that the drink could continue to be produced until the Zwacks could return, which they eventually did, founding the large distillery that stands today. The drink itself, a thick digestive, is known to be an acquired taste due to its (generously described) hearty flavor. Its bottle shape which is not unlike that of a cartoon wizard’s potion bottle, is yet another of the drink’s distinctive features. Inside of the museum located on the distillery grounds there is a video telling the story of the Zwack family and a tour through the history of the drink. Along the way the gallery walls are covered in display cases filled with a massive collection of mini liquor bottles numbering over 17,000, making it the largest collection in Central Europe. The tour finishes out in the basement where bold tasters can sample the varieties of Unicum straight from the oak barrels in which they are still aged for half a year.Unicum is no longer sold straight in the United States, instead a watered-down version simply called, Zwack is the only version imported.

       "  'On a windswept mesa overlooking the Hopi reservation in northeast Arizona are the ruins of the Awat’ovi settlement, the site of a violent clash of religion and culture.In 1700, Hopi traditionalists massacred Christian converts and destroyed all remnants of Spanish influence in an effort to preserve their unique identity. During the 16thand 17thcenturies, Spanish conquistadors, in their search for the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola, asserted control over the numerous Puebloan towns scattered throughout what are today Arizona and New Mexico.Across European colonies, white settlers brought Christianity with them. They often used religion as a tool of oppression, and banned traditional spiritual practices. Attendant Franciscan and Jesuit priests succeeded in converting many Native Americans, although the Puebloans secretly blended their traditional spirituality with Christianity in their own ceremonies held in traditional kiva chambers.Cultural tensions, famine, and brutal treatment of the native population eventually precipitated a coordinated rebellion in which the Spanish were overwhelmed by a surprise attack by every pueblo on the same day. Led by Popé from the San Juan Pueblo, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 successfully eliminated European hegemony, but only briefly as the Spanish gradually reasserted control by 1692.The native inhabitants of Awat’ovi, however, were divided on the question of welcoming back European (read: Christian) influence. Following an ultimatum issued by Hopi traditionalists in 1700, all men who cooperated with the Spanish or adopted Christianity were slaughtered, and the church was destroyed.Ironically, the word “Hopi” generally means “people of peace,” and violence is anathema to their belief system. Traditionalists, therefore, had to call upon a special Katsina ogre spirit to descend on the village and carry out the ultimatum.Following this devastating tragedy, Awat’ovi was permanently abandoned and the Spanish never returned to Hopi territory. As a direct result of the Awat’ovi revolt, the Hopi culture today is distinct from other pueblos for not including any European or Christian elements in their ceremonies, which continue to be performed much the same as they were hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago.Awat’ovi was excavated in the early 20thcentury by archaeologists from Harvard’s Peabody Museum. Recovered kiva murals have been reproduced and adapted to decorate numerous places in northern Arizona including buildings at the Grand Canyon. ',\n",

       "  'In 1899 a member of the D.C. Library board unexpectedly ran into Andrew Carnegie in a waiting room at the White House. The lucky chance encounterled to an on-the-spot $250,000 donation (written on the back of an envelope) and gave birth to Washington’s first central library. Prior to this point, the district’smeagre library was based out of a small three-story row house, and the idea of public lending libraries had only recently started to gain traction in the U.S. Traditionally, libraries were private collections guarded by universities and museums. The beaux-arts Carnegie Library of Washington, D.C. opened in 1903 and ended up costing a grand total of $350,000, more than $8 million in 2017 dollars. The self-described “University for the People” was the first racially integrated public building in the city and embodied Carnegie’s commitment to philanthropy and self improvement. The eye-catching facade is composed of Vermont marble, hung on structural steel provided by the Carnegie Steel Company. The interior is filled with natural light via four huge skylights that punctuate the building’s green slate roof. The main focal point inside is a grand staircase that twists and connects the main vestibule with ground level entryways. The D.C. Public Library wasn’t a one-off donation for Andrew Carnegie; he also financed projects in Washington such as the Pan American Union Building, the Carnegie Institution, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (not to mention 1,678 other libraries across the United States).Over the next six decades the D.C. library’s collection expanded in size from 65,000 to over 500,000. In 1972 the severely overcrowded Carnegie building was replaced by the nearby Martin Luther King Jr. building (which is an architectural gem in its own right.) The Carnegie building has been used for a variety of purposes over the years, including a stint as UDC’s graduate library and museum dedicated to D.C. history. It is currently home to the offices of the historical society, and an occasional event space. Update February 2018: In 2017, Apple announced they would sign a ten-year lease for the building. They plan to renovate the space and open an Apple store in the library space.Update May 2019: The Apple store inside Carnegie Library is now open.',\n",

       "  'The Orchard House was purchased by Louisa May Alcott’s father, Bronson Alcott, in 1857. It was a typical colonial house on 12 acres of land surrounded by orchard apple trees, giving the home its name. The Alcott family lived there for 20 years, and nobody could have imagined the prominence their home would gain in American literature.Louisa’s father was an influential figure in her life. He gave her a desk in times when it was considered inappropriate for a girl, and once said that Louisa would become the next Shakespeare. She did, indeed, become an extremely successful author. Her novelLittle Women, which was based on her own life growing up with her three sisters at Orchard House, was published in 1868 and became an instant classic.Louisa was not the only talented member of the family. Her sister May (the character “Amy” in the book) was a painter and she was sent to study art in Europe with the money Louisa earned by sellingLittle Women. Some paintings and drawings by May are exhibited today in the Orchard House. Louisa’s father was an educator and leader of the American Transcendental movement. He built a School of Philosophy adjacent to Orchard House, and it was herewhere he fulfilled his education reform goals. Many of his ideas are now included in school curricula, such as music lessons and gym classes.Nowadays, this historic house is a museum, retaining 80 percent of its original furniture. Visitors can tour through the kitchen, dining room, parlor, Louisa’s room, May’s room, an art studio, and the master bedroom.The tour guide will regale visitors with stories and anecdotes about the Alcott family.Louisa’s roomdisplays the small, white desk where she wroteLittle Womanand other books and poems. In the dining room, the Alcott sisters would perform their plays.Louisa’s sister, Beth, loved music, and the melodeon in the house is reminiscent of such skills. The parlorwitnessed the wedding of Louisa’s sister Anna (the character “Meg”) to John Bridge and it still has the original certificate of marriage.(Fun fact: Anna could not pronounce “mother” very well and instead would say “marmar” or “marmi,” the mother’s name in the book.)The master bedroom contains family photos, and it clearly reflects the essence of the house. Abigail May Alcott, Louisa’s mother, was considered part of the New England royalty; her great-aunt was Dorothy Quincy, who married the founding father John Hancock, the first governor of Massachusetts.Thestudy, meanwhile, is where Mr. Alcott welcomed some of the top writers and philosophers of the time, such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.',\n",

       "  \"Cesare Lombroso's Museum of Criminal Anthropology\",\n",
       "  'Once only open to academics, Lombroso’s Museum has opened its doors to the public.As the criminologist Cesare Lombroso examined the skull of the autopsied body of Giuseppe Villela, the notorious Italian criminal he had just dissected, he discovered a cranial anomaly known as a “median occipital fossette.” Lombroso was suddenly overtaken by flash of insight. As he would write many years later:“The sight of that fossette suddenly appeared to me like a broad plain beneath an infinite horizon, the nature of the criminal was illuminated, he must have reproduced in our day the traits of primitive man going back as far as the carnivores.”What Lombroso felt he had discovered would become his legacy and known throughout the world as the Italian School of Criminology. Lombroso felt that he understood the true scientific nature of crime and people who broke the law. According to Lombroso, a person didn’t learn to become a criminal—they were born to become one. Also called “biological determinism,” Lombroso’s theory of “anthropological criminology” and the upbeat sounding “positivist criminology” was that criminals were a kind of evolutionary throwback, physically devolved, and they couldn’t change because it was part of their biology.According to Lombroso’s theory, there were many physical characteristics tied to being a “natural born criminal,” including large jaws, forward projection of jaw, low sloping foreheads, high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose, handle-shaped ears, large chins, hawk-like noses or fleshy lips, hard shifty eyes, scanty beard or baldness, insensitivity to pain and long arms.Lombroso also falsely believed that race was an indicator of evolution with Black people being the least evolved and white people being the most evolved, or in his words “only we white people have reached the ultimate symmetry of bodily form.” Despite these beliefs (which were rather common at the time) Lombroso believed in reform rather than punishment, and was against capital punishment.As part of his studies Lombroso collected specimens, many biological, such as numerous skulls, but also weapons and other criminological relics. In 1892 Lombroso opened a museum in Turin (narrowly escaping having his collection seized by Rome) and bragged that “our school has attracted and convinced the best scientists in Europe who did not disdain to send us, as proof of their support, the most valuable documents in their collections.”Lambroso’s daughter described him as “a born collector–while he walked, while he talked, while he was engaged in discussion; in town, in the country, in court, in prison, on his travels, he was always studying something that no one could see, thus amassing or buying a wealth of curiosities, which at the time no one, not even he himself, could have placed a value on…”Among the collections he acquired for the museum are hundreds of skulls of soldiers and civilians, anatomical specimens from “far-off lands” as well as those of criminals and madmen, dozens of complete skeletons, brains, and wax models of “natural criminals” as well as “drawings, photos, criminal evidence, anatomical sections of ‘madmen and criminals’ and work produced by criminals in the last century, the Gallows of Turin, which were in use until the city’s final hanging in 1865 and the possessions of a man known as White Stag, a renowned impostor who convinced Europe he was a great Native American chief.”The collection is topped off by the head of Lombroso himself, “perfectly preserved in a glass chamber.”',\n",

       "  'Antikythera Mechanism',\n",
       "  'For over 2,000 years, a shipwreck lay off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera, its hidden treasures slowly corroded by the Mediterranean. It wasn’t until 1900 that sponge divers happened upon the loot, and found therein a perplexing device of remarkable engineering - though the divers had no idea how truly remarkable it was at the time. The device sat in a museum for fifty years before historians began to take a serious look at it.Known as the Antikythera mechanism and called a “clockwork computer,” this small bronze instrument is unique because it precedes any machine of comparable complexity by more than a millennium.The mechanism was built circa 200BC, and, with over thirty gears hidden behind its dials, it is easily the most advanced technological artifact of the pre-Christian period. Regarded as the first known analog computer, the mechanism can make precise calculations based on astronomical and mathematical principles developed by the ancient Greeks. Although its builder’s identity and what it was doing aboard a ship remain mysteries, scientists have worked for a century to piece together the mechanism’s history.Somewhat surprisingly, most consider it unlikely that the Antikythera mechanism was a navigational tool. The harsh environment at sea would have presented a danger to the instrument’s delicate gears, and features such as eclipse predictions are unnecessary for navigation. The mechanism’s small size, however, does suggest that it was designed with portability in mind. According to some researchers, a more plausible story is that the mechanism was used to teach astronomy to those with little knowledge of the subject.To use the instrument, you would simply enter a date using a crank, and, when the gears stopped spinning, a wealth of information appear at your fingertips: the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, the lunar phase, the dates of upcoming solar eclipses, the speed of the Moon through the sky, and even the dates of the Olympic games. Perhaps most impressively, the mechanism’s calendar dial could compensate for the extra quarter-day in the astronomical year by turning the scale back one day every four years. The Julian calendar, which was the first in the region to include leap years, was not introduced until decades after the instrument was built.While the Antikythera mechanism is the only known artifact of its kind, its precise engineering and the fact that similar instruments were described in contemporary writing lend strong support to the notion that it was not unique. It is thought that the famous inventor Archimedes of Syracuse constructed comparable devices. Some believe that the instrument came from the school of the astronomer Hipparchus. Whoever the builder was, they were likely Greek, as evidenced by the written instructions that are attached to the instrument’s face.Today, the Antikythera mechanism is housed is in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. A replica of the mechanism is also on view at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana. When Jacques-Yves Cousteau made his last visit to the shipwreck in 1978, he found no additional pieces. Nevertheless, the device continues to reveal its secrets to the researchers of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, an international effort supported by various universities and technology companies.',\n",

       "  'At the confluence of the Big and Little Duck Rivers near Manchester, Tennessee, there rises a steep-walled plateau of limestone. The lookout atop the promontory offers a grand view of the surrounding landscape, which may be why American Indians from the Woodland Cultural Tradition chose to build an earth-and-stone walled enclosure on it almost 2,000 years ago.The first European settlers to see this structure assumed that it was for defensive purposes and called it the Old Stone Fort. But the area enclosed within the walls lacks any archaeological evidence of prolonged habitation—such as postholes or trash midden—indicating that the fort was not a place of dwelling or defense. In fact, it would have been kept carefully cleaned of human detritus.The most likely explanation is that the site was a sacred ground used for ceremonies, a theory reinforced by the fact that the small earth-walled enclosure at the entrance to the fort was built to align with the sunrise of the summer solstice.The Woodland Cultural Tradition, which occurred in the Southeastern United States between 1,000 BC and 800 AD, represented a shift from nomadic cultures toward more sedentary, agricultural lifestyles. This settled existence led to the development of an elite social class who would have been able to organize and direct large-scale projects such as the building of the Old Stone Fort.The walls of the fort are made of stacked stones covered with earth. Though parts of the wall have eroded or been carted away for modern building materials, much of it remains intact.The Big and Little Duck Rivers cascade around the peninsula in a series of picturesque waterfalls and deep, blue pools. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, both rivers were dammed for power by a series of mills making paper, gunpowder, rope, and grist. The remains of many of these buildings can still be seen at the Old Stone Fort State Archaeological Park.A small museum in the park, appropriately faced with stone walls, provides exhibits on the archaeology of the fort along with the Woodland Culture as a whole.',\n",

       "  'If you’ve visited the National Mall in Washington, D.C., you’ve probably found yourself thinking, “Hmm, Lincoln, MLK, war veterans, Native Americans — sure sure, all fine and good, but how about some recognition for the Freemasons?” Well, good news: all you have to do is cross the Potomac, head down to Alexandria, and check out the George Washington Masonic National Memorial.Sitting atop a hill overlooking Old Town Alexandria, the memorial is dedicated to noted Mason (and first President) George Washington, celebrating him and American Freemasonry, as well as serving as a functional lodge and meeting/event space. The structure stands 333 (!) feet tall, was built to resemble the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria (!), and consists of nine (!) floors variously dedicated to Washington, Freemasonry, and specific rites and appendant bodies.The idea for a Masonic memorial to George Washington goes all the way back to 1852, but the project did not actually get underway until 1909, when a plot of land was purchased and fundraising began in earnest. Support for the project was driven not only by a desire to honor Washington, but also to create a permanent, fireproof home for the collection of Washington’s personal effects (a.k.a., “Washingtoniana”) owned by the Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22 (Washington’s Masonic lodge, which he had led for a time as the lodge’s Worshipful Master). Ground was broken in 1922, and the memorial was officially dedicated in 1932 in a ceremony attended by thousands. A special Masonic ritual was created for the dedication that involved pouring wine, oil, and corn onto a model of the memorial that, for some reason, had been made in a nearby prison. The U.S. House of Representatives shut down so that members could attend the dedication.While the all-granite structure and interior of the memorial was largely completed by the time of the dedication ceremony, the interior remained largely vacant and would not be fully finished until 1973. The first two floors consist of various halls and meeting rooms, while the upper floors contain the George Washington Museum (fourth floor), the Memorial Library (sixth floor), and various other attractions such as a replica Ark of the Covenant (fifth floor), a symbolic replica of the crypt beneath the Temple of Solomon (seventh floor), and a recreation of King Solomon’s throne room (ninth floor). If you want to learn more about the memorial, check out its excruciatingly detailed Wikipedia entry, including all 234 footnotes. It makes one suspect that the first Freemason was a guy who read that part of the Old Testament that resembles a contractor’s punch list from the Temple of Solomon construction project and exclaimed, “Now THAT’S what I call esotericism!”The first and second floors are freely open to the public; docent-led tours of the upper floors occur every hour. When you’re on the second floor, be sure to check out the statue of George Washington in Masonic regalia, as well the Memorial Hall and the Memorial Theater, both of which served as filming locations for — you guessed it — National Treasure: Book of Secrets.',\n",

A faint “B” for “Berry” can still be seen on the awning over the front porch.Berry is known as the father of rock ‘n’ roll, and the city refers to this house as “essentially… the birthplace of modern rock ‘n’ roll as we know it,” because of what the musician accomplished while living there. It is here that Berry wrote such classics as “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Johnny B. Goode,” and “Rock and Roll Music.”The house will soon be a museum and the center of an African American cultural district that will honor other former residents of the area, like Josephine Baker and Dick Gregory.The neighborhood, known as the Greater Ville, was an area of the then-segregated St. Louis, where black people could own property. Berry moved in just as he was starting a family, and around the time he bought his first electric guitar, started playing gigs with the Chuck Berry combo, and signed a record contract with Chess Records.Berry remodeled the basement and added a few rooms onto the back of the narrow house while he lived there. Today the house is owned by the city and in disrepair as it awaits its renaissance, but the layout remains the way it was when Berry lived there.',\n",

He started a post as a Minister at New Luce in 1660 before going on to lead the Covenanter movement in Scotland. After Charles II assumed the throne, Alexander had to flee his post and avoid being captured.Peden wandered Scotland and Ireland for 10 years preaching to followers, hiding his identity by wearing a cloth mask—on display at the Museum of Scotland—and hiding in caves. It’s alleged Peden would often preach in the woods.After years of escaping capture, Peden was caught and sentenced to four years and three months imprisonment on the Bass Rock, and then another 15 months in the Edinburgh Tollbooth. Later, he was sent to the American plantations as a form of banishment.It is said that Peden spent the last years of his life between Scotland and Ireland.

       "  'On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the military to forcibly relocate the 120,000 Japanese-American citizens from areas along the western coast of the United States into remote camps. The Topaz War Relocation Center was one such camp, located in rural western Utah.Once enforcement of the new law began, Japanese Americans were given mere days to sell off any possessions they weren’t able to carry or entrust to friends and report to the military for relocation. Those who didn’t voluntarily check themselves in were arrested. The Japanese-American internees were then transported to one of the detention camps located around the country, primarily in the American west.Life in the camps was harsh. When internees began arriving, the structures in the camps were still under construction. The shoddily built barracks let in drafts of dust during the summers and snow during the winters. At Topaz, temperatures in the summers frequently exceeded 100°F and in the winters the average temperature was below freezing. To speed up construction of the camp, internees were conscripted to work on the buildings. No furniture was provided, so they had to fashion their own with scraps of wood the army threw out. The perimeter of the camp was lined with a barbed wire fence and guard towers.Between the internees, staff, and guards, over 9,000 people lived in the camp at Topaz, making it the fifth largest city in Utah at the time. The internees passed their time in camp growing produce (which won awards at the Millard County Fair), playing sports, and making art. Internees published their own newspaper, Topaz Times, and a literature magazine called Trek. Detainees considered loyal by camp staff were permitted to leave the camp during the day to find work on nearby farms.From 1943 to 1945, internee Dave Tatsuno used a film camera smuggled into Topaz to shoot home movies of what life was like inside the camp. Tatsuno’s footage was made into a documentary called Topaz, and today is one of only two home movies preserved in the Library of Congress (the other being the Zapruder film of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination).After the war ended, most of camp was sold off, and the only remains today are a grid of roads and the concrete foundations where buildings formerly stood. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter created the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to investigate the necessity of Japanese internment. In 1983 the commission released its report, stating that the internment had not been of military necessity but was instead the result of “racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.” In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which was an official apology from the government to those who were interned at the camps and authorized the payment of $20,000 to anyone who was detained.Today, a museum in nearby Delta, Utah, documents this chapter in American history. On display are hundreds of artifacts, including art made by the detainees, uniforms, copies of the Topaz Times and Trek, memorabilia from the two elementary schools and high school that operated in the camp, and a recreation of what a typical barrack would have looked like in Topaz.',\n",

The private club never had more than 100 members at one time, and it flourished from 1888 until World War II put an end to the exclusive island party–but not before it served as a location that hosted the beginnings of the federal reserve.After the American Revolution ended, a French officer by the name ofDu Bignon rebuilt theHorton Houseon Jekyll Island, and brought the historical jewel of a property not only back to its former glory, but into a state of wealth and prosperity. When the island was split among his children, his son John Eugene Du Bignon bought his siblings out (along with a brother-in-law) and went about creating a retreat for the deepest pockets in the U.S., to whom they sold the location for $600 per share. 53 members purchased shares of the exclusive club, and it was decreed that members were never to exceed 100, to keep it nice and posh.Besides all of the usual tennis and horseback riding you’d expect from the privileged men and women of this America era, business was also conducted on the island, and in the main clubhouse. In 1910, a meeting was held on Jekyll Island between the top five financiers of the time, theAssistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department, andSenator Nelson W. Aldrich to discuss banking policy. This conversation sowed the seeds of what would eventually become legislation creating the U.S. Federal Reserve.The swanky southern playground served the well-to-do throughout the early 20th century, but it was not immune to the Great Depression, and WWII shuttered its opulent doors. The state of Georgia purchased the island in 1947, and in 1957, it placed a convict camp onto the property to get it all gussied up for public use, landscaping and all. It has since been turned into a self-sustaining historical spot of local interest, the club house is now a hotel, and there is shopping, activities, and a museum that demonstrates the island’s history, and the powerful men who used to roam its shores.',\n",

But on weekends, it’s buzzing with Americans hoping to see their relatives on the other side of the United States  and Mexico border.People come from hours away for their brief chance at interacting with loved ones. Families and friends who haven’t seen each other for years are both united and, yet, sadly still divided. Though they’re in the same place at the same time, even standing face to face mere feet from one another, a towering, impenetrable fence stands between them.The fortifications didn’t exist when the park was dedicated in 1971 by First Lady Pat Nixon. Only a monument and a chainlink fence marked the divide between the two neighboring countries. It truly was a place of friendship, as it had always been since the border was defined. People on both sides could hold hands and hug one another, share food and gifts, and even receive communion together.But security around the border strengthened as the decades passed, particularly after the events of 9/11. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security closed the park to construct a stronger, more impenetrable border. Now, two massive, well-guarded fences separate the two countries.The park finally reopened in 2012, after much backlash from activists. Every Saturday and Sunday, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., the United States Border Patrol allows people to trickle into the heavily supervised area. Though visitors can enter the outer fence, a second barrier of solid, steel mesh blocks them from crossing over to the other side.For visitors on either side, it’s as if they’re viewing their loved ones within some sort of temporary museum display—they may look, talk, and listen, but touching is no longer an option. The fences make it impossible for people on opposite sides to embrace one another. The only physical contact anyone can hope for is perhaps the brush of a finger slipped through one of the small gaps.People can, however, still pray together. On Sundays, two pastors from the Border Church hold service on at the same time on opposite sides of the fence. It’s a rare opportunity for families and friends across the divide to come together in song and prayer.',\n",

       "  'The turn of the 20th century was a time of prosperity for Asheville, and the world-renowned architects and artists employed by wealthy residents like George W. Vanderbilt III left a lasting mark on the city.One of the most distinctive landmarks from this time is the Basilica of Saint Lawrence, located in the heart of the historic district downtown. It was designed in 1905 by the Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino, who came to Asheville to work on Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate.Guastavino fell in love with the area and decided to make the Blue Ridge Mountains home. He also decided that Asheville was in need of a grand Catholic church. With the help of the architect Richard Sharp Smith, who also worked on the Biltmore mansion, and funds raised by Catholics in the community,Guastavino built the architectural marvel that stands today. It is the only basilica in western North Carolina, topped with one of the largest freestanding elliptical domes in the United States.The Basilica of Saint Lawrence is constructed in Guastavino’s signature Spanish Renaissance Revival style, an ancient building method from Catalonia that the Spanish architect revived and brought to America. It uses masonry materials such as stone, brick, tile, and mortar exclusively—there are no wooden beams or steel in the entire church foundation. Elements of Guastavino’s distinct style can be found in many famous landmarks, including Carnegie Hall, Grant’s Tomb, Grand Central Terminal, the U.S. Supreme Court building, the Boston Public Library, and the American Museum of Natural History.With its unique exterior and massive dome spanning 58 feet by 82 feet, the Basilica of Saint Lawrence stands out from the surrounding buildings in downtown Asheville. But the interior is a hidden gem, teeming with religious art. Highlights include Italian-made statues, beautiful stained glass windows from Germany, and a frescoed high altar cut from Tennessee marble.The church was opened in 1909, a year after Guastavino’s death. It was finished by his son, andGuastavino senior is interred in a crypt inside the church. The door of the crypt is another architectural marvel. Guastavino, Jr. covered the door with luster-glazed art tiles that he experimentally developed in his garage.Nearly a century later, the significance of the work was given the ultimate recognition: It was dedicated as a basilica by the Pope in 1993.',\n",

       "  'The Salem witchcraft trials took place between February 1692 and May 1693. More than 200 people were accused, 59 were tried, 31 were found guilty, and 20 were executed. Those final unfortunates were hanged, and one man was crushed to death while being tortured.Among the judges who convicted the witches (based on “spectral evidence,” evidence based upon dreams or visions) was Jonathan Corwin. As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He took the place of Judge Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned after the execution of Bridget Bishop. Corwin served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All 19refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence.The Witch House, as it is now known, was his home and is the only structure still standing in Salem, Massachusetts with direct ties to the Salem witch trials of 1692. The house was bought by Judge Corwin in 1675, when he was 24 years old, and he lived there for more than forty years. Corwin is buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-19th century.Today the house is a museum focusing on 17th-century living. It’s one of the last remaining links to a time in American history when people were hanged because they supposedly inflicted pain by the use of “venomous and malignant particles, that were ejected from the eye.”',\n",

       "  'Created in protest against industrial capitalism, World War I, and the rise of Fascism, the paintings are the work of aCroatian expatriate artist, Maximilijan “Maxo” Vanka, referred to by David Byrne of the Talking Heads as “The Diego Rivera of Pittsburgh.” If you prefer legend to history, that’s here too - St. Nicholas Catholic Church is also the site of one of Pittsburgh’slesser-known ghost stories.Maxo Vanka (1889-1963) is most likely the illegitimate child of Hapsburg nobility. Born in the days when Croatia was stillpart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the infant Vanka was given to a peasant woman named Dora and raised in a small village outside of Zagreb. At the age of eight, his maternal grandfather learned of his existence and brought him to a castle to be educated. Vanka went on to study art in Zagreb and Brussels, graduating with top honors in 1914, the year World War I broke out. The 25-year-old artist–already a confirmed pacifist–joined the Belgian Red Cross as a medic and saw some of the worst horrors of the war on the Western Front.In the 1920s, Maxo Vanka became one of his country’s leading painters, but in 1934, with Fascism on the rise in Europe, he immigrated to the United States.St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Millvale, Pennsylvania was part of the first ethnic Croatian parish in the U.S. St. Nicholas’s priest in 1937, Father Albert Zagar, commissioned Vanka–an immigrant like most of hisown flock–to paint a set of murals in the church. Vanka was an unorthodox choice for the job of creating what has been called “Pittsburgh’s Sistine Chapel.”  Though he described himself as spiritual, Vanka wasn’t a practicing Catholic, he was friendly to Socialist politics, and married to an American Jew (Margaret Stetten, daughter of a New York surgeon).Over the course of eight weeks between April and June1937, the artistcompleted the first round of murals–twelve paintings all told. The restwere finishedin the summer and fall of 1941,just months before the U.S. entered World War II.Though Vanka’s Millvale murals depict a plethora of traditional Christian religious themes, he brilliantly wove his own anxieties into the old Christian story, graphically illustrating the evils of Capitalism, the horrors of war, and Croatia’s “crucifixion” by theUstaše - a Fascist organizationthat was also fiercely Catholic and anti-Semitic. The murals are an incredibletranslationof Christian motifs into 1940spolitics. In The Battlefield Scenes, Jesus and the Virgin Mary arebayoneted by Christian soldiers; in another, the angel Injustice wears the garb of a nun and a gas mask, and holds a bleeding sword and a set of scales in which money outweighs bread; in Mati 1941, a femaledepiction of the artist’s belovedCroatian homelandhangs with her arms chained to a cross, shedding tears of blood.Several of Vanka’s murals delve into the travails of American labor. In Immigrant Mother Gives Her Sons for Industry, the dark mills and mines of western Pennsylvania–once the kingof American steel production–burn ominously in the distance while a dead worker lies on a Croatian newspaper surrounded by weeping mothers. In The Capitalist, an American industrialist in a top hat eats a sumptuous breakfast brought in by a black servant. As this king of industry (a jab at Pittsburgh’s rich) pores over a stock report, an angel shuns him and a skeletal hand containing fire reaches out toward him. The year is 1941.Several of Vanka’spaintings could be set either in Europe or America. In The Simple Family Meal, a working-class family dressed in traditional Croatian clothing shares a meal. Their heads are bowed in prayer while Christ, unseen except by the little girl (who Vanka modeled after his daughter Peggy), visits and blesses them.Around the altar and under a large painting of the Virgin Mother and Child (Mary, Queen of Croatia), Vanka’s countrymen in folkdress gather for their morning prayer (Pastoral Croatia). Vanka stated, “These murals are my contribution to America – not only mine, but my immigrant people’s, who also are grateful, like me, that they are not in the slaughter of Europe.”Then there’s the ghost. One night in 1937, a contemporary legend goes, Vanka was up late, hurrying to finish the first round of murals. That’s when he saw “The Millvale Apparition” - the title of an article published in Harpers Magazine in April 1938 and written by Vanka’s good friend Louis Adamic. Folklore has it that this was the ghost of a former pastor who neglected his priestly duties and was paying penance for failing to serve the parish well. Although Father Zagar was present, only Vanka saw the “black-robed figure making gestures at the altar.”Maxo Vanka went on to teach art at Delaware Valley College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, but never acquired widespread fame in the U.S. His Millvale Murals remain his greatest work. In 1963, while swimming off the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, he is thought to have suffered a heart attack and drowned in the Pacific. His widow and daughter donated many of Vanka’s works to the Croatian Academy of Science and Arts and the Michener Museum in Doylestown, PA.Tragically, Vanka’s murals were nearly lost to air pollution and salt damage caused by water. In justa few short decades, Pittsburgh’s notoriously dirtyair and the lack of air conditioning inside the churchtook a severetoll. The fine details of the murals were also obscured by the lack of lighting in the church. Professional lighting and restoration is ongoing today–with some dark squares left in a few places to show the extent of the filth that once covered these murals. Formed in 1991 as a nonprofit separate from the church, The Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka’s (SPMMMV) mission is to clean and restore the murals, install new lighting to improve visibility and enhance the visitor experience, and improve public information and access. As of 2020, SPMMMV has restored and permanently lit half of the Murals. The restoration is spectacular and thesehistoric paintings–an amazing testimony to the coming together of faith, art, and social justice–are one of the city’sbest off-the-beaten path attractions.',\n",

The unique structure—made primarily of redwood and 97,000 feet of white mahogany from Central America, and onyx from East India, Mexico and the Philippines—has continued to draw gawkers from all over the country. Today, the site is widely understood to be the most photographed and written about Victorian house in the United States.Built for William Carson (1825–1912), one of Northern California’s first major lumber barons, the intricately detailed mansion took more than 100 men over two years to construct.After failing to make a fortune in the mid-19th century California Gold Rush, Carson took to the forests of Northern California himself, felling shiploads of Redwood lumber bound for San Francisco. After a decade of working in the woods—and mining, when the seasons allowed—Carson formed the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company with John Dolbeer, who later invented the steam donkey engine that revolutionized the industry. By the 1880s, Carson’s company was producing 15,000,000 board feet of lumber every year.The Carson family sold the mansion in 1950 to the private Ingomar Club, which still uses the house and does not allow tours of the residence. If visitors were allowed inside the front doors, they would be treated to beautiful stained glass designs, plasterwork, and carved ornaments in various exotic woods.Meticulously maintained, the property today is in virtually the same condition as when it was built. While it could easily join the National Register of Historic Places, the Ingomar Club carefully guards its privacy, refusing to allow any outside influence.',\n",

In addition to the drama, traditional music and dance is also featured at the theatre.The nearby Oconaluftee Indian Village and Museum of the Cherokee Indian are also worth a visit, and are located close to the theatre.

       "  'This stunning estate with sprawling formal gardens wouldn’t look out of place in one of the grand old European capitals. Instead, the opulent brick-walled property sits on the hills above Washington, D.C., now housing a Harvard research library and one of the most under-appreciated museum collections in town. If you’ve heard of Dumbarton Oaks before it is likely vis-a-vis its connection with the 1944 conference that lead to the formation of the United Nations. For 47 days during the end stages of World War II, allied diplomats hashed out postwar objectives and rifle-toting guards patrolled the grounds. Today the estate has traded geopolitical conflict for academics and the arts. The Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and collection holds stunning exhibitions of Byzantine and pre-Columbian art, a collection of medieval and Renaissance art and furniture, and an immaculately landscaped garden. The original mansion has been expanded with several new wings, and each section has its own distinct design.The Byzantine art is housed in a Greek-inspired space complete with columns and mosaics; the pre-Columbian work in an elegantly finished modern space full of glass and light; and the medieval and Renaissance work is in a display space that was a part of the original residence. The land that Dumbarton Oaks sits on was once part of the Rock of Dumbarton grant that Queen Anne made to Ninian Beall in 1701. Around a century later, the first house was built on the property, and it was greatly expanded and renamed The Oaks in the middle of the 19th century. Among The Oaks’ notable residents was Vice President John C. Calhoun, who actually lived in the house during his first term in office.In 1920, Mildred and Robert Wood Bliss bought the property, and christened it Dumbarton Oaks in reference to its two historic names. According to the Cultural Landscape Foundation, the design of the estate’s gardens “is the result of a decades-long partnership between landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand and her client, Mildred Bliss.”Farrand, a founding member of the American Society of Landscape Architects, took inspiration from Italian Renaissance gardens while designing terraced flower gardens that transitioned into a more naturalistic landscape.The Bliss family gradually expanded the property to the 54 acres it occupies today. They also collected the artwork on display today, and donated the upper 16 acres to Harvard University upon their deaths. ',\n",

It began as a collection of plants donated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a small group of California gardens, in addition to the native species that grew onsite, such as willow trees and coastal scrub. Within two decades, the garden boasted around 1,500 plant varieties, and that number more than doubled between the 1950s and ’70s when the garden gained traction for its special collection of Eucalyptus and Ficus plants.The botanical garden became an important site for horticultural research and experimentation in the subtropical tree arena, and the UCLA campus cultivated an impressive arboretum.Today, the 7.5-acre garden is an educational resource, a research site, and a “living museum” that exhibits some 3,500 species plant varieties from across the globe.The plant collections are organized thematically and geographically, and include Ancient Conifers, Bromeliads, Cycads, Mediterranean Ecosystems, and Southern California Natives, among others.The garden was namedMildred E.

       "  'It’s not a theater and it’s not a cabaret, so what exactly is it? The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre is a collection of contemporary automata - a kind of mechanical sculpture - that functions as a kind of exhibition or museum. It started as a slightly offbeat crafts shop called Cabaret in Falmouth, Cornwall, more than 30 years ago. At the time, Sue Jackson sold simple wooden toys along with knitwear and ceramics that she designer herself. When Paul Spooner started working with Jackson, the designs grew more and more complicated.Usually people or animals, the automata are powered by motors, cranks, springs, heat, or hydraulics to produce motion through a series of cams or gears. Fascinated with the motion and spinning and action, Jackson quickly gave up knitting and ceramics to work on the automata; she saw how much pleasure they gave her customers.In May 1983, the Cabaret Mechanical Theatre began. Customers, Jackson and Spooner found, would pay just to turn the cranks and press the buttons that brought their creations to life. Most of the pieces on display, though, were built by only one or two artists. When business took off, Jackson commissioned more - and larger - pieces for her collection.Ever since, the Cabaret has continued to expand. With such a large collection, Jackson began sending some of her most famous and most complicated pieces overseas. The Cabaret Mechanical Theatre has now been brought to the United States, Japan, and countries all over Europe. “For Sue it is always a labour of love,” according to the Cabaret’s official blog. “It receives no subsidies or sponsorship, yet it helps to support a number of crafts people. CMT endeavours to remain a haven of wit, intelligence and individuality in an increasingly homogenous and mass-produced world.”Today, part of the collection is on display at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. While part of the collection used to be on permanent display in Covent Garden, once the lease ran out, the only way for visitors to enjoy the automata is to find a traveling exhibit. Details of exhibitions are listed on the website, which shows upcoming, current, and previous projects.',\n",

       "  'At first glance, the Smithsonian’s bare-chested George Washington statue seems a fine and stately fellow, with little indication of scandal wrapped up beneath the marble folds of his toga. But this unusual depiction of the first American president positively mortified onlookers when it was first displayed in the capital city that bears his name.Things began innocently enough back in 1832, on the centennial of George Washington’s birthday. Congress wanted to honor the occasion with a permanent shrine to the founding father. A prominent statue of the First Potus in the recently completed Capitol Rotunda seemed like just the thing. A 27-year-old American sculptor named Horatio Greenough was chosen for the task and sailed to Italy to select the marble and begin work on his prestigious commission. Young Greenough spent eight long years on the project before declaring the piecefinito finalmente in 1840. Problems quickly arose in actually transporting George to his home in the Capitol Rotunda. Twenty-two oxen did the backbreaking work of dragging the 12-ton president to a port in Genoa, where a U.S. Navy ship was waiting to pick it up. When the Navy ship proved too small for the heavy lift, a specially modified commercial vessel was enlisted. Finally, and at great expense, George disembarked in the Washington Navy Yard, only to be met by an unanticipated and shocked reception. Nobody in the Federal City had expected a semi-nude statue, and Washington’s chiseled musculature and robed garb seemed to them a mockery of the buttoned-up statesman. The founding father’s likeness, modeled on an ancient statue of Zeus, was depicted wearing sandals, cradling a sheathed sword, and pointing toward the sky.Greenough’s counterargument, that apparel of the 1790s already looked ridiculously out of fashion, fell on deaf ears.The statue’s saga then enters the brief chapter that actually takes place inside the Rotunda. Greenough thought his sculpture’s placement had bad light, and increasingly worried engineers pointed out that the monumental statue was in danger of collapsing through the Rotunda floor, potentially bringing part of the Capitol down with it. A large pedestal was brought out to better distribute the weight, but this failed to solve the problem and George was evicted from his home in the Capitol, cast without a shirt on his back into the east plaza.But this new locale further scandalized onlookers, many of whom believed Washington’s bare-chested physique looked absurd with pigeons perched on his appendages and snow accumulating on his lap during colder months. Still, this indignity continued for 20 years until a crack was discovered on the statue’s back and the Architect of the Capitol began the annual spectacle of erecting a temporary winter time shed around Washington.Finally, in 1908, exasperated lawmakers moved the controversial statue once again, this time to the Smithsonian Institution. The Washington Evening Star reported in slightly more diplomatic terms that Congress’ main reason for the change was that the statue “is semi-nude and looks pitiful out in the cold.”The enormous pedestal, nobly inscribed with “First in War. First in Peace. First in the hearts of his countrymen.” was separately commandeered and embedded in the walls of the new Capitol Power Plant. Later, in 1963, the Washington statue was moved yet again to the new American History Museum, where he resides, shirtless and toga-clad, to this day. ',\n",

One of the more notable groups of anatomical specimens is bone fragments and hair from Abraham Lincoln’s skull along with the bullet that ended the president’s life.We have Lincoln himself to thank for the preservation of these items, along with the rest of the collection at the NMHM. In 1862, Lincoln appointed William Alexander Hammond, a neurologist, to be the 11th Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. The National Museum of Health and Medicine was established that same year under Hammond’s orders. Its mission was to “collect, and to forward to the office of the Surgeon General all specimens of morbid anatomy, surgical or medical, which may be regarded as valuable.”The collection includes many items from the American Civil War, including medical instruments and an unusual human skull from a soldier who was shot across the top of the head, with the skull plate cleaving the bullet in two. General Sickles’s leg, which was amputated during the Battle of Gettysburg,supposedly arrived in a coffin-shaped box with a card that read, “With the compliments of Major General D.E.S.” It was put ondisplay soon after, and visited by the general for several years on the anniversary of the battle. Medical items on display in the NMHM includes anatomical and pathological specimens, such as a row of skeletons arranged by height that illustrate different stages of development, a conjoined twin specimen preserved in alcohol, and a Trichobezoar, or human hairball, removed from a 12-year-old girl who had been compulsively eating her hair for six years. The museum also houses antique instruments, and a huge collection of microscopes, notably the one used by Robert Hooke while he was writing Micrographia,as well as important historical medical documents. There is a special emphasis on military medicine, with representation from the wars of the 20th century.Keep an eye out at the museum for the off-white mummified head and shoulders of a girl who died naturally in the late 1800s and was embalmed using an arsenic-laced formula to illustrate the element’s preservative powers.The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.

The clear plastic counterpart is shaped to leave space for the sushi inside, and allows for the contents of the tray to remain visible to the customers.

Returning from her fourth patrol, the submarine was bombed by a British aircraft and only managed to slink back to port after weeks of repairs, earning it the title of “most heavily damaged U-boat to return to port.” During a later patrol mission, having endured years of ridicule due to constant equipment failures and resistance sabotage, the longtime commander of the vessel shot himself in the head while addressing his crew during a stressful depth charge attack that had finally pushed him too far. This is the only recorded incident of a commanding officer taking his own life while in charge of a fighting warship. All of this occurring before the capture of the U-505 that marked the first naval vessel to be successfully commandeered by American forces since the War of 1812. Were it not for the suicide and Nazis the ship’s tale could pass for a Mchale’s Navy script.Once the U-505 was captured it was secretly towed to Bermuda and placed in U.S. custody, in which it remains today. The entire submarine, left intact, is now a museum ship located in the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. Visitors can take tours of the ship’s interior or simply marvel at its size from the ground level, but either way, guests should try not to catch any of the ship’s bad luck. ',\n",

Now retired, the plane remains open to any curious visitor keen to wander through.SAM 26000, the first jet-powered aircraft built for American presidential passengers, carried eight sitting presidents (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, and Clinton) in its 36-year flying career. It is popularly known as Air Force One, though that name is technically only a call-sign for when the president is on board the aircraft in flight. It also transported other officials on Special Air Missions, or SAMs. The plane was adorned with its bright blue and white paint job at the request of Jackie Kennedy and designer Raymond Loewy.Possibly the most poignant moment in the plane’s history was when it flew John F. Kennedy’s casket from Dallas back to Washington, D.C. Four seats had to be taken out of the cabin to make room for the assassinated president’s casket. That same day, Lyndon B Johnson was sworn in on the plane, making making it the backdrop for one of the most iconic photographs from that era in American history.Throughout its career, the plane has taken presidents on many important visits abroad. It whizzed Johnson to Vietnam to visit U.S. troops stationed there. The aircraft carted Nixon during his “Journey for Peace” visit to China in 1972 and took Nixon, Ford, and Carter to the funeral of slain Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. In 1983, it even brought Queen Elizabeth II on a visit to the U.S. It continued carrying government officials and other important figures even after it was demoted from the presidential fleet in 1990.The plane has been in the National Museum of the United States Air Force since 1998. It’s housed in the brand-new fourth building, which is connected to the other three buildings of the museum. Visitors are able to walk through the craft and can even view where the back bulkhead was cut out to accommodate Kennedy’s casket.',\n",

Unfortunately the original wealthy couple who were building the castle for themselves divorced in 1975 while the castle was still under construction. For decades the castle sat unfinished and unopened gathering rumors of it being turned into a theme restaurant or a museum. Neither of these came to pass however.The site was eventually purchased by Thomas R. Post who began extensive renovations on the long dormant castle. However in 2004 a fire struck the construction site, ruining much of the progress that had been made. Despite the setback, Post redoubled his efforts on the property, sinking huge amounts of money into fixing the existing structure and adding new amenities such as a library, ball room, and full garden.In 2008, Castle Post was opened as a luxury event location and bed and breakfast. However for most Versailles, Kentucky locals will likely continue to remember it as the enigmatic castle at the top of the hill.  ',\n",

In the Cherokee language, the word used for “Green Place” is incredibly similar to the word for “Brass,” and the untrained ear of the white men who came to re-settle the land confused the two terms, changing the description of the mountain’s natural beauty to its current brassy misnomer.  Despite the altered name, the peak’s height and beauty has not been lost on visitors thanks in large part to the peak’s comfortably cool temperatures. Even in the summer, the temperature at the top of the mountain is usually 10 to 20 degrees cooler than the surrounding lowlands, making it a popular place for scenic sightseeing.Getting to the top is easy enough as a shuttle carries visitors to the observation tower at the summit, or true nature lovers can simply hike it. The visitor’s center on the peak has a museum with taxidermied examples of local wildlife like black bear and bobcats, as well as the stone observation tower from which the surrounding Chattahoochee National Forest is on full display.',\n",

Over time, it gained a new name, as it wouldn’t be proper telling folks back east that they passed “Elk Penis” on their journey.Standing an estimated 325 feet over the North Platte River valley in western Nebraska, with a 120-foot spire, Chimney Rock was a landmark on European settlers’migrations westward. The rock is composed of layers of volcanic ash, clay, and tough sandstone that protects the spire. It is so iconic that it was put on the reverse of the Nebraska state quarter along with a covered wagon.The name Chimney Rock was first recorded by Joshua Pilcher, a trader and Indian Agent in the area. The Lakota Sioux of the area didn’t use chimneys, so they didn’t use that name. Even the gruff local fur traders would use euphemisms to delicately dance around the Siouan name that meant “Elk Penis,” such as “Elk Peak,” “Elk Brick,” and later, Pilcher’s name of “Chimney Rock” that survives today.Visitors are welcome to the Rock at the Ethel and Christopher J.

The government threw flour, sugar, and lard at the hunger of the displaced, with which a staple of modern Native American cuisine was born. The deep-fried, doughy pillows called frybread are viewed today by some as a relic of oppression, but many others as a symbol of resilience.In a twist of historic irony, frybread now anchors the menu at Off the Rez, one ofWashington State’s fewNative American–owned restaurants.If that’s not enough to chew on, it’s in a museum celebrating the region’s natural and cultural history.Off the Rez co-owner Mark McConnell grew up eating frybread made by his mother, a member of the Blackfeet Nation. When he and his partner, Cecilia Rikard, launched a Seattle-area food truck—also called Off the Rez—in 2011, they sold showy renditions of reservation classics. Powwow burgers (beef, bacon, cumin crema, and pickled red onions on frybread), Indian tacos (frybread with pulled pork or chili), and sweet frybreads with an array of sweet toppings (Nutella is a crowd favorite) earned them somewhat of a cult following over the years. After the Burke Museum tapped the couple to open a brick and mortar cafe within their newly renovated building, the offerings took on a broader scope.In a sleek, brightly lit 30-seat cafe, diners can choose from all the food-truck classics locally known and loved as well as an expanded menu of pre-colonial dishes. Hyper-local, traditional ingredients are on display in customizable wild rice bowls, braised bison tacos on frybread, and a sweet potato salad with peppers, corn, and dijon dressing. Their 12-hour pulled pork makes a case for post-colonial foods, while a chipotle coleslaw expands the “Native” radius.Whatever you get, be sure to grab a bite before you go into the museum.

It was to incorporate the best parts of America with the best parts of England—civilized, hardworking Christians sharing in an agricultural community without harsh class distinctions.In its first decade, Rugby thrived. It attracted younger sons of landed British gentry, who, by birthright, received nothing of their fathers’ estates, as well as Americans seeking a planned community and culture. The self-selecting crowd reached about 300. They enjoyed a swath of highbrow pursuits, such as theatre, croquet, literary clubs. Around 70 buildings were constructed in a stately Victorian style, including the Tabard Inn (named for the one in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales) and a free public library named for the town’s founder, Thomas Hughes, a popular British author of the period.But there was soon trouble in paradise. A typhoid outbreak killed a number of Rugby residents, and because newspapers were watching the town’s progress closely, the tragedy was widely reported on. The Tabard Inn burnt down two times in as many decades. The town suffered financial troubles too, despite the fact that Hughes funneled $75,000 of his own funds into development. He tried to start a tomato cannery, but the inexperienced farmers were unable to produce enough tomatoes. Newspapers ridiculed Hughes and Rugby, and by 1900 itwas nearly deserted, with only a handful of residents remaining.Sixty years laterBrian Stagg stumbled upon the dilapidated community and vowed to make it a historic landmark. By creating the Historic Rugby Foundation, Stagg was able to restore the buildings that still stood and rebuild the ones that had been destroyed, according to their original Victorian design. Now, Rugby is one part museum, one part town. Nearly 85 people live in the historic homes, and the community is still growing, with plans to build a park and more houses. The Historic Rugby Foundation hosts tours and events that uphold traditional Victorian crafts and pastimes. There are Appalachian storytellers, English dancers, ghost tours, wood whittling workshops, and of course, lots of people in period dress. The Rugby Colony was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and retains several original Carpenter Gothic-style landmarks, including Christ Church Episcopal, Thomas Hughes Free Public Library, Rugby School, Kingstone Lisle, Uffington House, and Newbury House.

       "  'Lunch boxes bring back a certain sense of nostalgia for most people. What most people don’t know however, is that these cherished, childhood, snack-bearing boxes, or at least the old metal ones, were once classified as weapons. For a while, lunchboxes were illegal.The metal lunch pail made its appeal to American youth in the 1920s. At first, many were plain and lacked any sense of individualism. Eventually, companies, of which Disney was the first, started releasing licenses to lunch box makers to use their characters and iconic figures as decals. It was during this time that lunch boxes began to signify a child’s individualism and uniqueness. The design on your lunch box said something about who you were.In the 1970s, a group of outraged, disgruntled, Floridian mothers lobbied against the metal boxes, saying children were swinging them at peers and wreaking havoc on their gentle skulls. Many other states soon followed and popular lunch box companies were forced to switch to vinyl products. The last metal box was produced in 1985.1998 saw the reappearance of new metal lunch boxes with designs such as Godzilla and Hot Wheels. After their release, there was no outcry.Though it seems like there would be a large variety of lunch boxes created, the truth is, between 1951 and 1985, only 450 metal lunch boxes were released with distinctive character designs. All other lunchboxes are not considered collectibles.A collector by the name of Allen Woodall, who operates the Lunch Box Museum in Georgia, has achieved the task of acquiring all 450 metal lunch boxes, as well as a handful of copies. He began collecting lunchboxes in the 1990s after he inherited a small collection from a deceased friend. He continued to collect lunch boxes and, after a promise he made to the widow of his deceased friend, started the museum.Today, Woodall’s museum is stuffed with some 3,500 metal lunch boxes and their matching thermoses. His collection grows as he continues to trade his duplicates for rarer pails, some of which are valued over $2,500. As children once traded food from their lunch boxes in the cafeteria, Woodall continues to trade his vast collection of metal lunch boxes.',\n",

While the name in itself is an attraction, a trip inside the townyields even more quirks.Truth of Consequences was originally named Hot Springs after the dozens of geothermal spring-fed spas that came to dominate the town. By the late 1930s, Hot Springs was filledwith 40 different natural hot springs spas—one spa for every 75 residents at the time. But then, to draw in even more tourists, the towntook a bolder move. In March of 1950, the popular NBC radio show “Truth or Consequences” promised free publicity to the first American city to rename itself Truth or Consequences. Hot Springs decided to take up the offer, and after a citywide referendum voted in favor of the name change, was awarded the honors. The “Truth or Consequences” radio show was aired from Truth or Consequences on April Fool’s Day, 1950, a major event for such a small town.Since 1950, the radio host, Ralph Edwards, revisited Truth or Consequences every year for 50 straight years on the first weekend of May. Upon each visit, he was welcomed by a “Fiesta” of beauty pageants, parades, rodeos, rubber duck races, and the Hatch Chile Queen, a tradition that, despite Edwards’ death, is still celebrated today.Since the 50s, Truth or Consequences has been featured on multiple “unusual place name” lists and was even the site of the Doctor Who episode “The Zygon Invasion”, which based its plot on the city’s unique name. T or C, as it’s known to locals, has also used its unique name to its advantage for promoting its spas. Says a local resident,“it is the truth that we have the health-giving waters here. The consequences are that people get results.”Throughout the city, a variety of interesting sites can be found.The Geronimo Springs Museum, for instance, features old windmills, Native American art, and wooden figurines. The adjacent Las Palomas Plaza is a public park where you can dip your feet inrushing spring-fed waterin a surreally designed setting, resembling the set of a Star Trek episode. Past the historic WPA-built downtown are murals, a bull statue, and a war memorial with an eagle standing atop a globe on one leg. Also found throughout town is a painted water tank, a wigwam, and a polka dotted bench reading “WET PAINT.” In fact, from the town’s visitor center, you can even take a tour of Spaceport America, the world’s first purpose-built spaceport, just 25 miles down the road.',\n",

After seeing his giant iguana sculpture called Iggy on the roof of the LoneStar Cafe in New York City, an arts nonprofit commissioned Wade for a public art piece in Washington D.C.After six months at 12th and G streets, the boots were taken—with a considerable amount of trouble—on flatbed trucks to the North Star Mall in San Antonio, Texas, a process Wade memorialized in the song “Too High Too Wide Too Long.”In their first few years at the mall, a DJ broadcasted live from the top of the boots during the San Antonio Rodeo. People would have tailgate parties just outside. During a particularly rowdy year, someone got excited and kicked a hole in one of the heels, making way for a homeless person to stay for a while. He was discovered and booted after mall-goers noticed the billowing smoke from a Sterno can he used as a stove.In 2016, the Guinness Book recognized the giant pair as the world’s largest cowboy boot sculpture.

The educational exhibits are perfect for anyone seeking to soak up information about the squishy sea animal (yes, sea sponges really are animals).The factory’s colossal collection is no surprise, as the factory and museum are within the self-proclaimed “sponge capital of the world.” The Florida city has largely dominated the sea sponge scene since the early 20th century, when a man named John Cocoris introduced mechanized methods for harvesting the aquatic animals.Cocoris, a Greek man, recruited divers from his native country. They spearheaded an industry that generated millions of dollars each year. Diving and harvesting became one of Florida’s leading maritime industries up until 1940, when a blight caused the sponge population to dramatically decline. Thankfully, the species has since recovered and the sponge harvesting business is once again booming.Tarpon Springs has embraced both its industrial and cultural heritage. In addition to Spongeorama Sponge Factory, it boasts historic sponge docks and sponge diving boats that are open to tourists. The city, which has the highest percentage of Greek Americans of any city in the United States, pays homage to Greece via its architecture, cuisine, and traditions.Update as of January 2020: Unfortunately, the museum found in the gift shop is currently closed due to hurricane damage.

St. James, Director of Special Projects for the State of Eternity. As best can be determined by art historians, St. James dedicated his off-work hours from about 1950 until his death in 1964 assembling the Throne, his monument to God. For over fourteen years, he assembled jelly jars, coffee cans, scrap wood and metal, deceased light bulbs, and recovered tinfoil into something wonderful. Since James hired no help and sought no publicity, it was only upon his release from this world that his work was shared when the garage’s owner sought to rent the space out again and made the Throne available to the art world. It eventually landed in the hands of the Smithsonian and hence became part of our national heritage.St. James’s work today resides on the first floor of the museum, near the southwest corner, in the Folk Art exhibit. The most dramatic way to approach the Throne is from the north, coming through the Special Exhibitions section. The Throne is thirty yards ahead and proudly assembled in a dark purple alcove, as it should be, like an altar. Fifteen years of light bulbs, foil, and other rejects made somehow amazing.

More than 300,000 people have visited the castle and its surrounding grounds every year since it was reopened in 2002 after several years of restoration done at a cost of 11 million dollars. The park includes the castle museum, a visitor center, gift shop, concessions, picnic areas, hiking trails and much more.But most of the people come to see the castle, which is filled with a number of oddities personally designed by Gillette including unique hand-carved door latches, a liquor cabinet with a hidden lock and a mirrors set up in the Great Hall for Gillette to spy on visitors.William Gillette built a quarter scale narrow gage railroad to ride around the property. He had 2 engines, several passenger cars and 3 miles of track that went over bridges and through a tunnel. His restored electric engine is on display in the Visitors Center. The purple hiking trail at the park is known as the Train Trail and goes along the route Gillette’s train once ran.',\n",

Once-called “house cars,” someof the most important and interesting campers and motorhomes in the history of the industryare on display at this museum, the “RV capital of the world.”The RV/MH Heritage Foundation established an RV museum in Elkhart County, where more than 80 percentof RVsare manufactured. Walking through the exhibit in Founders Hall, which has representations of RVs from 1913 through the 1980s, is a trip through time. The winding pathlooks like a blacktop road, complete with lane-dividing white stripes, and fake trees and plants replicating the vehicles’natural habitat: nature.The 1913 camper, and oldest surviving RV, is the Earl Travel Trailer, which features a table and two benches that, just like they do in modern trailers, convert into a bed. The Spartan Imperial Mansion from 1954 was one of the first all-metal trailers, a result of the Spartan Aircraft Company having had a surplus of metal after the end of World War II. It was huge and luxurious—the Cadillac of trailers. The 1931 Chevrolet house car that Mae West rode to and from Paramount whilefilming is also on display.There’s a 1967 Winnebago, a 1958 Airstream, and exhibits highlighting innovations like the first RV toilet and microwave oven. On the second floor, the Hall of Fame pays tribute to the more than 400 people who are responsible for such innovations over the years. There is also an archive of thousands of periodicals, manuals, and photographs all having to do with the RV industry.More recent examples of RVs are in the Go RVing exhibition hall, which features five contemporary campersthat visitors can enter and explore, as well as a 1/24th scale model of an RV assembly plant. Nearby RV manufacturers offer tours of their own full-sized facilities,in case a trip to the museum doesn’t satisfy your RV curiosity.Appropriately, museum’s parking lot accommodates RV drivers, with 65-foot-long pull-through parking spaces.',\n",

       "  'The enormous brick structure that now houses the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., was originally constructed after the Civil War to house the Pension Bureau. A force of 1,500 clerks used the magnificent space to sort through the mountain of paperwork associated with the 890,000 pension claims from veterans of the Union Army.Pensions were a very big deal after the war; they made up almost a third of the government budget in the 1880s, and half of the legislation in the 49th congress wasspecial pension acts.The building’s architect, Montgomery Meigs,a veteran of the Civil War who served as quartermaster general, conceived of the structure as both a hall of records and a memorial to the conflict.Congress stipulated that Meigs was to use brick and metal, fireproof materials that would keep veterans’ records safe more economically than carved stone. The scale of the building project resulted in a region-wide shortage of bricklayers during the summer of 1883. Meigs brought in skilled workers from cities across the north and got local home builders to delay their projects until the Pension Building was completed.The Italian Renaissance Revival architecture was a sharp departure from the neoclassical marble norms that had previously dominated government buildings. The building’s interior features massive75-foot-tall Corinthian columns, some ofthe largest interior columns in the world. On the red brick exterior is a glorious 1,200-foot terra cotta frieze depicting Union soldiers.Today we can draw a parallel between its style and thatof the smaller brick marketplaces that used to dot Washington. Interestingly, “Meigs’ red barn” drew sharp criticism when it opened, with General Philip Sheridan famously complaining that it was “too bad the damn thing is fireproof.” The Washington Post reported that Rep. Dunham called the building an “architectural monstrosity” and Rep. Rogers called it “a cross between a horse-car stable and a union depot.” Rep. Springer declared that “it was offensive to the vision, and … the present ornamentation should be blown up with dynamite.”However, not everyone was against it. Senator McMillan and the powerful Speaker of the House Joe Cannon praised the offices as comfortable, well ventilated, and “better adapted to its purpose than any public building in Washington.”The building’s interior design did have several clever features.The office galleries were laid out in arcades around a massive central atrium. This allowed the hot summer air to rise up to the top, where ventilating fans expelled it through the roof. The offices also have unusually high ceilings that contributed to this cycle.Figuring that thousands of disabled veterans would have to climb the stairs between floors, Meigs built gently sloping steps with unusually wide treads and short risers. This early attempt at accessibility predated the Americans with Disabilities Act by a century and a half.The crush of paperwork that moved around the building each day also necessitated a novel technological solution.Meigs built a special document-moving system that whisked baskets around on rails that ran the perimeter of each floor. The original rails are still visible today on the third floor. A separate dumbwaiter system could lift papers up and down vertically.The Pension Bureau eventually became the Department of Veterans Affairs, which relocated to new offices in 1930. The building then passed to the General Accounting Office, which occupied it until 1950.The GAO remodeled the space and converted the ground floor into glass-ceilinged cubicles.By the 1960s, the building was in a state of disrepair, and Congress considered demolishing it. The influential DC architect Chloethiel Woodard Smith proposed establishing an architectural museum. In 1980 Congress took up the idea and created the National Building Museum, which stands today, fittingly dedicated tothe history and impact of the world’s architecture, engineering, construction, and design.',\n",

Impressive as it is, the work of art is eclipsed by the store’s true star: its vast collection of French books.Albertine is physical proof of the French government’s dedication to fostering intellectual exchange between French and American people. It’s a haven for both francophones and bibliophiles alike. The bookstore, which is sponsored by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, was started in 2014 in the historic Payne Whitney Mansion. It contains over 14,000 books from 30 French-speaking countries and is the only store in New York dedicated entirely to books printed in French and English.It’s a beautiful space, a quiet respite from the bustling city. In addition to its stellar ceiling, the bookstore is adorned with busts of famous figures from French and French-American culture, such as Descartes and Benjamin Franklin, and a floor-to-ceiling mirrored Venetian room. A replica of Michelangelo’s Young Archer sculpture stands in the building’s entrance. Its predecessor, which is believed to be an original Michelangelo work, was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art after decades of being ignored.Visitors can pop into the store and peruse its expansive stock of literary titles.

His works often depicted large-breasted women in lurid situations but contained pointed satire and criticism of Czechoslovakia’s communist regime. A number of his works were banned during their initial release, and his work was not made available in full until the 1990s.Saudek died in June of 2015, but his work continues to live on in the permanent gallery above the Batalion Bar in Prague. The space is owned by a father-son team, the elder of which was a friend of Saudek’s. The gallery located on the second floor of the club holds a number of Saudek’s original pages under glass. The bar space itself is decorated with enlarged color versions of his panels, with sensational figures of half-naked women and angels popping out of nearly every surface. Unsurprisingly, this also adds to its raucous atmosphere. (Make no mistake, this is also a standard crazy-weekend bar).Should you fall in love with Saudek’s work, the Batalion also sells reproductions, shirts, mugs, and memorabilia. Fans of comics, rebellion, drinking or simply unknown artists could well do for a visit to this bar that certainly would have been banned at an earlier age.Update as of January 2022: Although the museum is now closed, the bar is still open.',\n",

Hill was famous for having pioneered modern road building techniques and creating many of the scenic highways of the West, but it was his work on his utopian vision that got everyone saying “What in Sam Hill?”Hill was a Quaker and used his money to organize and fund a Quaker utopian community on the banks of the Columbia River in the early 1900s. Unfortunately no Quakers besides Hill ever moved there and his utopian vision failed after a few short years. Nonetheless, Hill continued with the construction of a French Mansion—in steel and concrete—on a cliff overlooking the Columbia River.Hill was friends with various socialites and celebrities, including Queen Marie of Romania, who was living in exile at the time. Parisian modern dancer Loïe Fullerconvinced Hill to turn his mansion into a museum, and today the museum houses Queen Marie’s throne, crown jewels, wedding dress, and icon collection. You can also find original sketches, statues, and plasters by Auguste Rodin (The Thinker, Gates of Hell), Native American Baskets, one hundred unusual chess sets, and Belle Epoque art in the collection.The ranch surrounding the museum also contains the Hill Loops Road—the first macadam asphalt-paved road in the Pacific Northwest—which was built by Hill and takes the driver down scenic, but steep, twists and turns.One can also visit “Stonehenge” at the museum, a replica of the original in England. Hill, a dedicated pacifist, built this concrete Stonehenge as a memorial to the human sacrifice of war, making this is the earliest World War I war memorial in North America. Hill’s grave sits nestled in the hillside just below.Until recently this was all set miles from civilization in the bleak basalt and cheat grass of Eastern Washington. In the past few years, vineyards and fruit orchards have sprung up nearby, making Hill’s original dream of a utopian community easier to envision.',\n",

There’s neon, electric, hand-painted, aluminum, and LED. They run the gamut from historic neon signs to a rescued 76 gas station ball. There are signs from local mom-and-pop grocery stores displayed next to an enormous Arby’s hat. It’s an eclectic and unexpected assortment, just like Tucson itself.The Ignite museum started as the personal collection of Jude Cook, who has spent his life in the design and sign industry. His work is familiar to any Tucsonan; his company built the city’s iconic neon saguaro at Main Street and Drachman, and restored beloved historic signs including the Tropicana, the Picarretta-Davis diving girl, and the Canyon State Motor Lodge.Over the course of 40 years, Cook collected signs from across Arizona and the U.S., and acquired a reputation as the person to call when you needed an old sign hauled off quick. After his collection grew too large to store, he decided to put it on display for everyone to enjoy. Ignite Sign Art Museum opened to the public in 2018.Visit Ignite on a typical day and you’ll see signs in various states of repair and refurbishment.

Done in a full two-thirds sphere, rather than the typical half dome, the massive steel structure was seen and admired by over 5.6 million visitors who went into the dome to see exhibits from actual spaceships from the Apollo missions to American works of art.The dome’s steel skeleton was fitted with a clear acrylic covering, making the structure look like a massive, glittering jewel.When the fair ended, the pavilion remained. The dome was originally meant to be bolted together, allowing the pavilion to be dismantled when the fair was finished, but budget constraints led workers to weld the dome together instead, securing the dome’s place in Montreal’s landscape.The sphere would remain open to the public for nine years until an accident involving some routine welding maintenance caused the acrylic covering to catch fire, engulfing the entire sphere in a spectacular ball of fire with flames that burned for 30 minutes. When the flames subsided, there was no sign of the acrylic walls to be seen, but the steel trusses of the dome remained. After the fire, the dome was closed to the public for over fifteen years.In June 1995, the dome rose from the ashes and was re-purposed as a museum devoted to environmental action. The reopened dome sported no acrylics on its exterior this time around, due to the costs of keeping the gigantic dome warm and cool, and probably to prevent future accidents. However, the dome was hit with another disaster in 1998 when an ice storm forced the biosphere to close for five months.The biosphere reopened, and still houses the museum. Through the fire and Canadian ice storms, the Biosphere of Montreal remains, a sturdy and beautiful example of “Bucky’s” geodesic architecture.',\n",

       "  'The city of Berkeley is home to Chez Panisse, the Alice Waters restaurant widely credited with spreading the gospel of sourcing and celebrating local, sustainable ingredients. But the most profound example of this philosophy can be found just a few minutes away, where foods local to the Bay Area are made and served by the people who first lived there.Cafe Ohlone is a remarkable achievement, the resurrection of the cuisine of local Native Americans by two members of the Ohlone tribe whose ancestors hunted and gathered in the area centuries ago. Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino met at a 2014 conference on native languages, and bonded while listening to phonograph records of tribal-elder interviews from the 1930s. They were struck by the detailed information on culinary techniques, which were disappearing. Their ancestors explained which plants to gather, which fish to catch, and the rituals of making the old dishes. They listened, learned, and then re-created the techniques.After a few years of perfecting the recipes with other tribal members, Medina and Trevino decided to share the experience with the wider community. In September of 2018, Cafe Ohlone’s staff served their first lunch on a patio behind Berkeley’s University Press Books, an academic bookstore.Unlike other local cafes, it is no grab-and-go stop for students hurrying between classes. The experience begins with a solemn prayer in the Chochenyo language and a brief explanation of the history of the native peoples of the East Bay Area, from pre-contact to the present day. It’s a tale of a people who determinedly preserved their language and culture despite indifference and persecution from successive Spanish, Mexican, and American governments.At each meal, Medina and Trevino introduce each of the dishes, which are based on wild ingredients gathered locally by native people. The menu is seasonal, but a typical spring meal includes a salad of watercress with sorrel leaves, blackberries, gooseberries, and popped amaranth seeds. The cress has a mildly peppery herbal flavor that mixes well with the citrusy sorrel and tart berries, and the amaranth adds a satisfying crunch and slight nuttiness. No matter the season, expect multiple courses and refreshment from tea rather than alcohol—often an older family member’s longtime recipe, and always a local herb. Any meal’s flavors will be a true expression of Californian terroir.Meals may conclude with songs, a fast-moving round of an ancient gambling game, or simply time for questions. Cafe Ohlone’s combination of delicious, unique food with a history and anthropology lesson has proved popular, though the difficulties of sourcing wild foods limit how often they can open. Now offering midweek lunches, tea tastings, Sunday brunch, and occasional Saturday dinners, Cafe Ohlone provides an opportunity to savor the first California cuisine and meet the people who brought it back to life.Update: Thecafeclosed its originallocation behind the bookstore on Bancroft Way, but will be reopening in late July 2022 in a new space just up the block, on the patio of the PhoebeHearst Museum at the UC Berkeley campus.',\n",

Cotton Mather wrote“Among the other Curiosities of New-England, one is that of a mighty Rock, on a perpendicular side whereof by a River, which at High Tide covers part of it, there are very deeply Engraved, no man alive knows How or When about half a score Lines, near Ten Foot Long, and a foot and half broad, filled with strange Characters: which would suggest as odd Thoughts about them that were here before us, as there are odd Shapes in that Elaborate Monument..”As far back as 1783, people were making wild accusations about the origins of the rock. Congregationalist minister and academic Ezrz Stiles was convinced the rock was made by Ancient Phoenicians. This gave way to speculations that the Norse did it, then that early Portuguese explorers carved it (possible), and most recently (and most unlikely) that the Chinese did it, proposed in the 2002 book “1421: The Year China Discovered America” which proposes the Chinese got here 70 years before Columbus.Despite a few hundred years of speculation, the extensive petroglyphs on the rock have still not been explained conclusively. The most likely hypotheses attribute them to Native Americans or to the Portuguese explorer Miguel Cortereal. Proponents of pre-Columbian exploration of the Americas by Vikings, Phoenicians, and so forth, continue to claim these inscriptions as evidence.Dighton Rock has been moved from its original location at the waterline of the nearby Taunton River, to a tiny museum in Dighton Rock State Park.',\n",

Thebuilding served as living quarters and gathering space for Chinese immigrants who came to the United States in the pre-World War II era. As more people arrived, the neighborhood was filled with similar buildings to house these pioneers. Generally, retail businesses lined the storefronts while Chinese family associations—community and social groups—proudly displayed their presence along fancy top-level balconies. The remaining space provided lodging to newly arrived laborers, almost all single. Japanese and Filipino immigrants also gravitated to these inexpensive hotels.Many of the original Chinatown-International District buildings have now been converted into modern apartments. Others remain vacant except for the ground floor retail space, leaving historic spaces languishing with little upkeep. The East Kong Yick Building was in such a state until 2008 when it was renovated to create the new home of the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience. The museum, named after Seattle city councilman Wing Luke (the first Asian-American elected to office in Washington State), includes modern galleries showcasingrotating art and history exhibits.

Volunteers are on-hand to give you a personalised tour.The player piano was a very popular American invention of the late 1800s. The latest evolution of musical automata, these self-playing pianos began to emerge along with mechanical adaptations for standard pianos in the 1870s. Most of them required a human user to use the foot pedal bellows to run machinery that pulled scrolls of pre-programmed music past the mechanical parts, which then activated the keys of the piano. The name Pianola was a trademark of the The Aeolian Corporation of New York in the 1890s, but the name was broadly applied to all player pianos. Export to Europe began in 1899 where these expensive machines quickly gained popularity in the posher homes and music halls.The program scrolls were made of normal paper, punched with holes or slits to correspond to notes, much like early computer punch cards. Some composers took advantage of the new technology to design songs that could not be played with a mere ten fingers, creating unique pieces exclusive to the machine’s inexhaustible supply of virtual fingers. Sadly, most of these compositions are rather unlistenable.The wonderfully scenic Jordaan neighbourhood where this museum is located has long been gentrified (though you can still witness its roots during the Monday Morning Flea Market on Noordermarkt). But in the heyday of the pianola, it was still distinctly working class and could not afford such fancy technology.However, the district did have a roll-making factory. When this business went bankrupt, the factory was taken over by a certain Otto Frank who moved in with his family to set up a business—the building is indeed now known as the Anne Frank House. (As an odd parallel, an IBM punch card system similar to that of the pianola was used by the Nazis to help facilitate the streamlining of mass genocide.)By the end of WWII, the pianola market had dried out: radio and vinyl record players had completely taken over. And while vinyl records are currently enjoying a renaissance, it’s not likely the same will happen for the pianola. As of 2018, the museum has also faced the danger of an impending sale of its building. So support this wonderful hands-on museum while you still can!',\n",

The American Prohibition Museum in Savannah, Georgia, follows the complex history of this movement, from its early days through the consequences of the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition in 1933.Impressively, the museum entertains without being corny and educates without being preachy or pedantic. Visitors are greeted in the entrance by a Model T beer truck and myriad slogans, headlines, and “saloon art” that set the stage for the national debate. To reach the main exhibit halls on the second floor, one must climb a stairwell plastered with quotations on drinking and alcoholism and listen to an evangelical preacher proclaim the evils of liquor in a historical film.Appropriately enough, the museum’s story of Prohibition begins in a saloon, where a mannequin of the famous and fierce temperance advocate Carry Nation wields a hatchet over the bar (Nation was notorious for destroying saloons’ property with the weapon). Meanwhile, history comes alive as performing docents, dressed like barkeeps and flappers, answer questions and share saucy tales.Another exhibit covers the various illegal workarounds to Prohibition with the dark stillness of a moonshiner’s hideaway followed by a well-lit bootlegger tableau replete with weapons confiscated from mobsters. To avoid the gangster racket, you can escape into a nearby speakeasy, if you know the password. Once inside, guests can drink 1920s cocktails while listening to music from the golden age of jazz.The museum is remarkably comprehensive. All the usual suspects from popular perceptions of Prohibition are present, but the museum is also adept at interweaving Savannah’s local history into the chronicle while also revealing the many less obvious effects of Prohibition. For example, the engineering of cars was radically altered and improved as a result of creating faster and stronger bootlegger vehicles to outmaneuver G-men (slang for “government men,” or agents). Meanwhile, speakeasies paved the way for greater racial integration. There were, of course, negative effects, too: Nativism increased as Irish whiskey distillers and German beer brewers were targeted as lawbreakers.',\n",

       "  'There is a small but worthy cabinet of mathematical models and calculating machines in the University of Arizona math building. Originally used to teach undergraduates, these models are now appreciated for their simple elegance.The models are examples of a movement in the late 1880s to the 1930s to reform mathematics education. The models were used to demonstrate math concepts in a three-dimensional manner. One set of models, called the Baker models, were produced commercially by Richard P. Baker, an Oxford educated mathematician who moved to Chicago in around 1900 and started selling models to universities and schools. His first catalog described 100 models and had grown to over 500 by the time of his death in 1937. His catalog demonstrated an “enormous range, including solid geometry, projective geometry, algebraic geometry, Riemann surfaces, surfaces from the theories of electromagnetism and thermodynamics, and representations of probability distributions.” He also made models of complex electromagnetic reflections which are included in the collection and are often not taught to undergraduate students.The Baker model collection is the most extensive collection in the western US and one of only a few Baker collections in the US, including one at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution.The models may no longer be relevant in a computer age but the skill and craftsmanship can still be appreciated as works of art.',\n",

The Nash Metropolitan was also sold as a Hudson when Nash and Hudson merged into the American Motors Corporation (AMC), and it was later sold as a Rambler. All early Nash vehicles were designed by Pinin Farina of Italy, but Farina refused to allow his name to be associated with the Metropolitan because it might damage his reputation to be linked to such a small car.Also in the museum is a Metropolitan hook-and-ladder fire truck that was used as an amusement park ride in New York, and Jimmy Valentine’s first Met, which is all original, including upholstery, rubber floor mats, and Goodyear tires, only driven 18,000 miles.

Best known as the author of several short story collections and the satirical war novel Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut was an important chronicler of 20th century American culture, and always a true Hoosier. He was born in Indianapolis in 1922, to a well-known local architect and daughter of a wealthy brewer. His early years were ones of privilege, but the Depression hit the Vonnegut family hard. With money in short supply, people all but stopped hiring architects, and Prohibition put the nail in the family’s beer coffin. After Kurt finished high school he studied for a short time at Cornell, dropping out to join the army. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and survived the bombing of the city of Dresden. As a POW housed in an underground meat locker, his story of survival and war experiences became the basis for Slaughterhouse-Five.The library/museum is housed in a downtown building called the Emelie, built in 1902 and listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. The staff are not only curators of Vonnegut’s work, but advocates of his ideals. In addition to their collection of his drawings, books, papers and letters (some of which are original publisher rejection letters), there is a recreation of the writer’s personal work space, a reading room, and a small art gallery. They see themselves as a unique cultural and educational resource, reaching into the hearts of readers, Hoosiers and beyond. Maybe that’s the best description of Vonnegut himself.On November 9, 2019, the Kurt Vonnegut Museum & Library moved into its new “forever home” at 543 Indiana Avenue in the Indiana Avenue Historic District (listed on the national register of historic Places).',\n",

The artist had previously collaborated with his father on other battle scene cycloramas,panoramicimages on the inside of acylindricalplatform,which were extremely popular in Europe in the 19th century.The commission for the Gettysburg Cyclorama came in 1879 from a group of Chicgo-based investors. The massive painting was created by five artists over a year and a half. The final installation included not just the painted backdrop, but three-dimensional artifacts and objects in the foreground to lend further realism to the scene.It was originally exhibited in Chicago in 1883 and was so successful that copies were made and exhibited in Boston, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn. It is the Boston copy that is now on display at the Gettysburg National Military Park Museum and Visitor Center. The Philadelphia version is known to have been destroyed; the location of the Brooklyn version is unknown.The cyclorama on display in Gettysburg was restoredby the National Park Service in 2005 and measures 377 feet in circumference and 42 feet tall. It weighs in at an estimated 3 tons.Although few cycloramas of the hundreds that once lured crowds around the world still exist, there are a few notable survivors: In Wroclaw, Poland, the enormous 120-year-old Raclawice Panorama lets you step into the middle of the 1794 Battle of Racławice.

The property has more than just cattle and bison: It features excavated Anasazi dwellings, a Navajo hogan and sweat lodge, and amazingly well-preserved examples of petroglyphs carved byAmerican natives.Archaeological records show that people have been passing through the area for 13,000 years. Hunting and gathering groups, semi nomadic farmers, and later sedentary farmers have left their mark on the land.The area is still considered to be an active sacred site; over 3,000 petroglyphs have been found throughout the property, most of which are dated from between 5000 BC to 1400 AD. The petroglyphs, which were made by carving into the rock’s surface, line the walls of an accessible two-mile canyon. Images of animals, people, and unknown symbols are easy to spot. One particularly imposing and beautiful petroglyph is of the Mother Of Game, whose life-sized image graces one of the stone escarpments.Brantley Baird,the owner and proprietor who has lived on the ranch since 1948, allows visitors to stop by and see the petroglyphs. Though not academically trained, Baird discovered many of the sites himself and believed it was important to share them with the public. He has a modest but fascinating museum on the grounds that offers American Indian artifacts found on site, as well as cowboy and pioneer items.

However the event that would forever mark the tavern as a place of note was the “turtle feast” held by George Washington himself at the end of the war wherein he bid farewell to his officers with a rousing toast and a personal conference with each.After the war, the pub and the building attached to it became home to a number of early American governmental congresses for a time when New York was made the official capitol of the country. It remained protected as a historic building, but eventually became less talked about in subsequent years.The site was later brought back into the spotlight during the 1970’s when a bomb placed by FALN, the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation, a group devoted to seeing their home removed from U.S. control, exploded in the doorway of the bar. A number of people were killed and countless others wounded, but the ale house lived on.Reconstructed as Fraunces Tavern, the bar is now a popular tourist site and after-work spot for Wall Streeters.

While in Verona, the Wild West performed in the ancient Roman Amphitheater. His tours were so successful at home and abroad that by the turn of the century he was regarded as the most recognizable celebrity on earth.Aside from creating Buffalo Bills Wild West, Cody founded the town of Cody, Wyoming where he built hotels and ranches; he had a hand in early water reclamation, irrigation, and animal conservation, and was an early supporter of rights for both women and Native Americans.Cody died of kidney failure on January 10, 1917, surrounded by family and friends in Denver, Colorado. Upon the news of his death, tributes were made worldwide, by figures such as King George V of the United Kingdom, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Imperial Germany, and President Woodrow Wilson.Though Cody was buried on Colorado’s Lookout Mountain, a site selected by his wife and sister, the city of Cody, Wyoming, demanded a “return” on his body, feeling he should be buried within the town he founded. A rumor started that Cody’s actual body was exchanged for a look-alike indigent, and he had been taken to Cody for burial. Considering that the funeral was open casket and attended by thousands, including close family and friends with photos taken of those same family and friends next to the casket, someone swapping Cody’s body is hard to believe.The controversy became so heated that a guard was mounted over the grave until a deeper shaft could be blasted into the rock below.The controversy continued with Cody’s niece claiming officials had exchanged the body following the death of Cody’s widow in 1925. Cody’s foster son,Johnny Baker, ordered Cody and his wife be disinterred and reburied under tons of concrete to prevent anyone from stealing their bodies.Today Buffalo Bill Cody’s grave can still be found at the top of Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colorado. A small museum resides nearby and is owned by the City and County of Denver, CO.',\n",

It sits at the end of an out-of-the-way promenade at the northern tip of Fort McNair, and its placement seems almost accidental. Get close enough to read the inscription and theplot thickens: “To the brave men who perished in the wreck of the Titanic - April 15 1912. They gave their lives that women and children might be saved.”So how and why did a Titanic memorial end up here, in this quiet corner by a Washington army post? The short answer is, it didn’t start out here.The Titanic Memorial first lived further north, in a coveted spot along the Potomac. At the southern end of Rock Creek Park between Georgetown and the Lincoln Memorial, the statue first stretched those elegant arms out towards the city, with the wide river flowing just behind. It was unveiled in 1931 by Helen Herron Taft, widow of William Howard Taft who had been president at the time of the sinking.The figure had been chosen in a competition, restricted to female artists, sponsored by a group who called themselves the Women’s Titanic Memorial Association. It’s about 15 feet tall standing on a wide granite base, and was designed by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. She was not only an artist but a prominent socialite patron of the arts, benefitting from the double wealth whammy of being a Vanderbilt and marrying a Whitney.Her design was chosen in 1914, two years after the disaster, but it took almost 20 years to collect the funds—which they did not from Whitney, but mostly from small dollar-by-dollar donations. (Ironically, by the time it was paid for and unveiled, it was the same year Gertrude founded the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.)The memorial held its original ground until 1966, when it was removed as part of the plans to build the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Once knocked off it pedestal, the piece languished in storage for a couple of years, re-emerging in 1968 where it now stands. And sadly, where hardly anyone ever sees it.There are lots of Titanic memorials, collections and museums around the world, and you can check some of them out here.

The original pueblo that stood on the site belonged to a tribe of Native Americans who vacated the site in the early 1400s leaving the pueblo behind. Eventually the spot was resettled by the Spanish who brought Tlaxcalen warriors in tow. The Indian warriors ended up establishing their own neighborhood that became the El Barrio de Analco, but this settlement too was mostly disbanded during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. After retreating during the fighting, the Spanish eventually returned to the area, and by the end of the 19th century Navajo and Apache tribesmen had moved in as well.Through all of the turmoil, some remnant of that original pueblo has always remained, making the De Vargas Street House a sort of keystone to the history of Santa Fe. Existing for all of its peoples and cultures. Currently there is a craft shop and museum inhabiting the space. Even though it has been refurbished, the old western portion of the building still has the dirt floors, low ceilings, and adobe-style walls that it had hundreds of years ago.

Bauman’s plans for the land were seemingly simple: demolish a 1950-era apartment complex and build a luxury condominium in its place.During a routine archaeological survey of the site, however, hundreds of mysterious holes were discovered in a layer of Oolitic limestone bedrock and Bauman’s development plans immediately came to a halt. Through further investigation, twenty-four of the largest holes comprised a perfect circle, 38 feet (12 m) in diameter, and excavation results found a variety of artifacts ranging from human teeth to ancient tools.Included in the artifacts were pieces of burnt wood which, after being tested for radiocarbon dating, are believed to be 1800-2000 years old. To date, Miami Circle is the only known evidence in the United States of a prehistoric structure built into bedrock. Evidence from this mysterious prehistoric “footprint” predates other known settlements along the East Coast.The site is believed to have once been occupied by the Tequesta Indians, a local tribe whose known tools matched some of the shark tooth-related artifacts found during excavation. Theorists have suggested that the holes were structural postholes or part of the foundation for a building. Some believe the building was used for ceremonial purposes, as animal bones and unused tools appeared to be offerings.Among these tools were two axe-heads made from basalt, a hard stone that is not indigenous to Florida. The finding of these tools contradicts the theory that the site was occupied by the Tequesta, however, as the volcanic rock is believed to have been from a location in Macon, Georgia - some 600 miles (970 km) away from the site.The mysterious origin of the site has led to its nickname as “America’s Stonehenge”, (though there are a number of sites nicknamed this) and some critics and conspiracy theorists have offered alternative theories. Aliens, Mayans and septic tanks are among some of the suggested origins for the holes.The State of Florida eventually purchased the land from Baumann after a series of high-profile disputes between Native American groups, contractors, and historic preservation committees.

Branches punctured the hull, and within a day the entire boat was sunk. Many attempts to salvage the boat and its cargo were made, but the river’s current was strong enough that itcompletely covered the vessel, smokestacks and all, within a few days. TheArabia was abandoned at the bottom of the river.For the next century and a half, the ship remained a popular piece of locallore, especially for the Sotor family who owned the property on which the wreck was sunk. In 1987, Bob Hawley and his two sons used old maps and a metal detector to find the ship, which they eventually located beneath a layer of mud and silt. The Hawleys and a handful of family friends, a massive crane, and 20 irrigation pumps began pumping water out of the ditch. Excavation took roughly one year, but as soon as theyreached the sunken hull they began uncovering treasure.They found remarkably preserved pioneerclothing, guns, tools, and more. Entire crates of chinawere perfectly preserved, the straw they were packed in still yellow and dry. There was food which, though probably not appetizing, was still edible, including 29 jars of pickles. The excavators even uncovered the skeleton of the shipwreck’s only casualty: a mule which had been tied to the deckat the time of sinking.Today, all of theArabia’s cargo is on display at the Treasures of the Steamboat Arabia museum. A re-creation of the boat itself transportsvisitors back in time. This is the largest single collection of pre-Civil War artifacts, and it provides illuminating insight into the material needs of American pioneers.',\n",

       "  'There is only one place in Nevada where you will find a shrunken human head, taxidermy animals, Egyptian tomb artifacts, antique firearms, and well-endowed Polynesian fertility statues under one roof. The Wilbur D. May Museum houses the private collection of its namesake, who traveled the world throughout the 20th century collecting oddities and exotic wonders.Wilbur D. May was born in 1898, an heir to a successful department store chain. However, Wilbur found himself unhappy in routine business work. Despite many attempts to make a go at taking over his father’s business, he found himself inevitably drawn to adventure in exotic locales instead.He volunteered as an ambulance driver early in World War I, and later took lengthy vacations from his father’s business to hunt big game in Africaand Asia. In a fluke, he actually made money off of thestock market crash of 1929. He invested in burgeoning oil industries at the advice of a hunting acquaintance and increased his fortune. He used his wealth to continue traveling the world, breeding racehorses and Boston Terriers, flying airplanes, and sponsoring world travels for youth groups.Like many eccentric millionaires, Wilbur was a collector. Throughout his travels he traded with locals for artifacts which he brought home to his ranch in Reno. Upon his death the massive accumulation was converted into a museum. The motley mix of artifacts runs the gamut of history. You’ll travel the world as Wilbur did, seeing the assortment of things he picked up in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific.There’s fine china and silver, giant elephant tusks, 6th century BCE figurines, African tribal masks, Japanese swords, snuff bottles, American Western art, and more. You name it, Wilbur brought it back with him and it’s on display in his museum. The highlight is his shockingly large collection of trophy mounts from the golden era of safari, displayed in a recreated version of his trophyroom, where nearly 200 pieces of taxidermy (mostly heads) decorate the walls.The museum has an old-school cabinet of curiosity vibe. Youget the feeling as youwalk through that it is a collection out of place, a relic from a time whencultural artifacts were up for grabs for travelers who hadthe money. Wilbur was a man of his time. His museum offers visitors a chance to step into the shoes of an eccentric millionaire and his impressive collection.',\n",

The Silverball Museum Arcade is home to 180+ functioning pinball and arcade machines that transport the beach-goer to a 1960s diner.For $10, the pinball wizard enters Rob Ilvento’s vintage collection of 1960s to modern arcade games. The pinball museum (one of only three in the world according to its owner) provides an entertaining and interactive journey through pinball history. Well-placed placards describe how to navigate the levers, knobs, and slides of each game and also honor the high-scorers who have conquered the game.The machines’ vibrant interfaces display a range of cultural events and icons from the last half-century. Take a look at “Beat Time,” the pinball machine created at the height of 1960s Beatlemania. The 1979 “KISS” and 1980 “Ali” games will evoke multi-generational nostalgia. The younger generation might enjoy taking a whack at The Sopranos or Simpsons games. The museum reflects the evolution of American pop culture through the arcade’s display of celebrities, sport teams, and dance moves.The Arcade Museum also offers “Pitch N Hit” baseball, mechanical bowling, and Skee Ball for those uninfected by the pinball bug. Pinball junkies will also have to tolerate some “modern” games such as Ms. Pacman, Galaga, Centipede, Asteroids, Super-Breakout, and of course, Pong.After besting the high score of a favorite game, celebrate at the Arcade’s café with a hot dog, funnel cake or NJ’s classic salt-water taffy.If you’re at the beach and need a break from the sun, grab a flipper, pound a few bumpers, and experience what the kids of yesteryear played before video games.',\n",

       "  'In the depths of the Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago is a carpeted room withwindows into 68 gorgeously decorated rooms—each built to the scale of 1 inch: 1 foot.The rooms were aproject byNarcissa NidblackThorne, who marriedtheheir to a department store fortune. As a child,she’d always loved dolls and dollhouses; as an adultwhotraveled extensively through Europe, she made it a hobby to collect miniature furniture and accessories.To house hercollection, Narcissa drewdesigns for several rooms to holdher treasures, and commissioned cabinetmakers to construct them. It was 1932, and unemployed craftsmen were plentiful. Over time, though, theproject became increasinglyambitious. In 1936 she was asked to create a miniature version of the library at Windsor Castle to mark the (ill-fated) coronation of Edward VIII.Inspired tocreate more facsimiles of real rooms from some of Europe’s mostimpressive castles, museums, and homes, she hired architects andmembers of the Needlework Guild of Chicago to get the designs just right, down to the tiny textiles and carpets.The Thorne Miniature Rooms are beautiful examples of painstaking craftsmanship, and of architecture and interior decoration from specific places and periods. Visiting theThorneMiniature Rooms Exhibition allows museum-goersperiod-accurate glimpses into European and American interiors from the late 13th century all the way through the 1940s, in a way that logistics like time and spacewouldn’t otherwise allow. They were featured at exhibitions and art museums throughout the United States before finally settling at the Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago. (Three more are in the collection of the Indianapolis Children’s Museum, the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles, and the Phoenix Art Museum, and nine can be found in the Knoxville Museum of Art in Tennessee.)The collection at MAIC, though, is thought to be the largest collection of miniature rooms in the world.But, like any rooms, Thorne’s creations get dirty and require maintenance. The skilled team of Art Institute staff members tasked with cleaning the miniature rooms aren’t little elves or regular-sized humans wielding feather dusters and vacuum cleaners scaled to size. Rather, these extremely gentle humans come armed with cotton swabs and eye droppers, attacking the works with a degree ofpride and skill necessary whenmaintainingimpossibly small handmade time machines.',\n",

       "  'The Senator',\n",
       "  'Visiting one of the oldest living organisms in the world was at one point quite easy. Thought to be the eighth-oldest tree in the world, the bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) affectionately known as The Senator once stood in a small park in Longwood, Florida.Its estimated age of 3,500 years made The Senator only slightly younger than the carefully guarded Great Basin Bristlecone Pine of California known as Methuselah. The Senator was alive not only during the time of Jesus, but for 1,500 years before that when the Greeks destroyed Troy, the Olmecs were powerful in Mexico, Solomon succeeded King David, and Stonehenge was being constructed. Unlike the secret location of the ancient pine, the cypress was supremely—perhaps too—accessible.The “Senator” was the largest tree east of the Mississippi and stood at 118 feet tall with a circumference of 35 feet. (A hurricane in 1925 damaged the top of the tree, shortening it from its original height of 165 feet.) Its tremendous size made it useful to both Native Americans and early settlers as a marker when traveling through the area. Tourists have frequented the area to view the tree since the 1800s and the land on which it resides was donated to Seminole County by the late Senator M.O. Overstreet to ensure the preservation of the tree (hence the name).Unfortunately, on February 29, 2012, Seminole County police arrested a woman who confessed to causing a fire that destroyed the Senator. Sarah Barnes and a friend were smoking inside the tree, and using an open flame as a guide. After the fire broke out, Barnes took photos and video with her cell phone and later showed them to several people, which led someone to tip off investigators. Apparently, she left the fire burning, and the tree was engulfed days later, burning from the inside out. Though the park is still open, the tree is no longer standing.In 2014, county workers planted a 50-foot-tall clone in Big Tree Park (named “The Phoenix,” via a county-wide elementary school contest) and a 60-foot clone of the old tree in Reiter Park (also located in Longwood, Florida). There were 10 trees cloned from “The Senator” in the 1990s, and these two were from the seven that survived and flourished. Of course, it will take thousands of years for these trees to grow to the size of their “parent.” The Senator also shared space with a tree known as Lady Liberty. This companion bald cypress is a comparatively youthful 2,000 years old and still stands a proud 89 feet in Big Tree Park.The Senator will live on in various artworks created from the charred wood and ashes of this once mighty tree. County officials realized future generations of Seminole residents would not be able to see the ancient tree that lived at the time of Florida’s Timucua tribe. Several tons of the tree’s remnants were distributed to artisans to create artworks, with the agreement that it would be donated to the county. 18 organizations also received remnants for display, including the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, and Ripley’s Believe It or Not Museum.',\n",

       "  'Drink a beer whilst you admire stuffed cougars and shrunken heads.Albert Friedrich was just a 17-year-old bellhop in 1881 when he purchased the building across the street from the hotel he worked at and opened a saloon. In what could have been an ill-advised business move, he began accepting antlers, horns, pelts, and other game trophies as payment for drinks.A skilled furniture maker, Albert would craft the trophies into chairs and tables, which were sought after by the likes of Kaiser Wilhelm. These went on to decorate the ceiling and walls of the bar, eventually coating it entirely. His wife, Emile, got in on this action as well; she would accept jars of rattlesnake rattles and then use them in decorative works of folk art.The Prohibition era could have proved disastrous for the Buckhorn Saloon, but the Friedrichs stayed afloat by charging admission to their ever-growing collection of curios. When alcohol was legal again, they doubled their income by officially opening as a twofold saloon and museum.Through several changes of ownership and one massive move to a more central location, the Buckhorn Saloon and Museum has remained a fixture of San Antonio’s tourism industry. It won’t be difficult to spot The Buckhorn from San Antonio’s riverwalk: The building is adorned with giant plaster heads of longhorn cattle, elk, and buffalo.Though it is billed as a museum of wildlife, the Buckhorn’s museum sports some impressive specimens, including a 10,000-year-old prehistoric elk. But the museum also sports a robust collection of oddities. There is a hall oftaxidermy fakes, or gaffs, which boasts a “Manboon” and a Feejee mermaid that is equal parts monkey and fish.Other non-wildlife related items reside in the Texas Ranger Museum, part of the Buckhorn. Part of the exhibitincludes a replica of San Antonio at the turn of the century, which contains a model of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow’s car, complete with bullet holes.The wax figure exhibitportrays important events in Texan history, with a little bit of dramaticflair.

       "  'The Old Patent Model Museum',\n",
       "  'Before the Smithsonian reopened the building in 1968 as the new home of the American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, this beautiful room was the Old Patent Office model hall. Inventors used to have to submit working models along with their patent applications. As technology progressed during the Industrial Revolution this “Temple of Invention” was stuffed to the gills with intricate miniature machines.In its heyday, the Patent Office was one of the busiest office buildings in Washington. Every day, hundreds of inventors and attorneys from across the country came to search the patent records. The model hall predated the Smithsonian Institution by a decade and was a must-visit attraction for tourists.The building was commissioned after Congress passed the landmark Patent Act of 1836 to collect “a general repository of all the inventions and improvements in machinery and manufacture, of which our country can claim the honor.” In its first year the Patent Office received 765 patent applications, but within 50 years the number of annual applications had grown to 41,048. The rate continued to increase year after year after that.From 1836 to 1880 miniature models were a required addendum for all patent applications (The Washington Post explained this as a way to “get rid of the perpetual motion cranks”). The Patent Office collection brought in hundreds of thousands of these miniature wonders, creating a one of a kind industrial museum. Visitors could examine Eli Whitney’s mechanical cotton gin, Samuel Morse’s telegraph, George Westinghouse’s air brake, Joseph Glidden’s barbed wire, as well as 1,093 Thomas Edison inventions.The patent trade supported a cottage industry of model shops in Washington. Several of the shops are visible in the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps of the neighborhood around the Patent Office.During the Civil War the Patent Office and its model hall were enlisted in the war effort for use as barracks and hospital space. Soldiers slept in three-level bunks among the rows of glass cases.Walt Whitman frequented the Patent Office during his service as a nurse. He described the “immense apartments” as “fill’d with high and ponderous glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil, machine or invention, it ever enter’d into the mind of man to conceive.”The decade after the Civil War was the high water mark for the Patent Office’s model collection. In 1877 a fire destroyed the third floor of the building and 87,000 models were lost. Finding space for all the models had always been a problem—the Washington Star wrote that “the government resorted to such storage places as the commerce building, the crypt at the Capital, and a rented garage at Seventh and F Street NW.” After the 1877 fire the government gave up and rescinded the model requirement from the patent application process.In 1926 the Patent Office moved to get rid of the collection entirely. According to the Washington Star, “The Smithsonian looked them over and took about 15,000. The rest were sold at auction over six years beginning in 1926.” Many of the models were bought up by Sir Henry Wellcome, but his dream of a patent model museum was tabled by the 1929 stock market crash.In addition to the Smithsonian and Wellcome hoards, several private museums have amassed large collections of patent models. The Rothschild Peterson Patent Model Museum in New York has 4,000; The Hagley Museum in Wilmington has 870, the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn has 90.The Old Patent Office Building itself was almost torn down in 1953. Congressman Charles Oakman thought that the property was the ideal location for a new parking lot that could “solve Washington’s downtown parking problem.” Thankfully it was saved from the wrecking ball by an early historical preservation campaign, and repurposed as the Smithsonian Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture. Today the old model hall houses open storage for more than 3,000 artworks, such as paintings, folk art, and fine crafts along with some of the patent models in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.',\n",

It centers around a Hopi-style pueblo and is full of artifacts from American Indian and Alaska Natives, as well as work by contemporary artists.Cabot Yerxa, an explorer, activist, builder, Mason, and much more, built the American Indian-inspired structure from scrap materials he found in the surrounding desert. The entire pueblo is handmade, meticulously crafted from sun-dried bricks and wood leftover from abandoned cabins.Before completing the museum, Yerxa was notable for having discovered the two hot springs that spew the now-famous mineral waters of Desert Hot Springs. He was also the founder and president of the local Theosophical Society.Yerxa began constructing the 4-floor, 35-room building in 1941 and worked on it up until his death in 1965. With a bit of initial help from a trusty mule named Merry Christmas, he labored for over two decades on the unusual abode. He designed the house to take advantage of natural ventilation to help keep it cool, and drew inspiration for its shape from a replica of a pueblo he saw at the Chicago World’s Fair as a child.Though the building still wasn’t complete, Yerxa debuted “Cabot’s Old Indian Pueblo” in 1945. He dedicated the Hopi pueblo in honor of the area’s native tribes. Yerxa and his wife ran the museum up until his death. The estate was then briefly abandoned and vandalized, but it has since been restored after being donated to the city by one of Yerxas’ friends.Now, Cabot’s Pueblo Museum exhibits artifacts and artwork, as well as content from Yerxa’s own life. Cabot’s Trading Post & Gallery, located right near the main pueblo, sells work made by local artists.In May of 1978, the museum also gained Waokiye, a towering wooden sculpture named for the Lakota Sioux term for “traditional helper.” It was made from a 750-year-old felled Sequoia redwood tree and is one of 74 giant carved heads created by Hungarian sculptor Peter “Wolf” Toth.',\n",

After being discovered, Stubby won over the commanding officer by sitting and saluting with his paw at the command to “Present Arms.” He stayed with the soldiers for 18 months, once being hospitalized for mustard gas, another time being injured by a German grenade. He proved an invaluable compatriot as he could warn of mustard gas attacks, hear incoming missiles before the men, and find the living wounded in No Man’s Land.

Inspiration for the shuttlecocks came from a painting in the museum by Frederic Remington that featured Native Americans wearing feathered headdresses coupled with a satellite image of the museum grounds that resembled a grassy ball court.Today, three of the displays lie onthe front/southside of the museum building and the fourth is on the back/north side.

Central to the movie’s plot are the lengths to whichagents from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) are willing to go in order to containits destruction. Though certainly not a new phenomena, the effect this (entirely fictional) film had on the American populace’s subconscious was fascinating. All of a sudden, a new generation of people began caring deeply about how the spread of disease and viruses are managed here at home.Listen: We’re not saying the timing of this museum’s arrival on the scenewas 100% related to the public interest spawnedby Outbreak, but the David J. Senser CDC Museum didopen its doors to the alternately curious or concerned public the following year, in 1996. In a factual sense, we know that the museum was created in conjunction with a variety of celebrations marking the CDC’s 50th anniversary.Contained therein isa variety of multimedia and in-depth displays celebrating that ephemeral combination ofscience, technology, and humanity so unique to managing public health for a population of 319 million people. Exhibits on display include glimpses into emergency preparedness from a top-down standpoint, safe water for all, a history of how the United States eliminated malaria from within its national borders, and the newest epidemic to affect America: obesity. No detail is considered too small for consideration within the museum’s walls; food labeling is given its turn as an element of public health, as is HIV testing, and a breakdown of the effects of environmental chemicals on bodily functions over time.Several decades on from Outbreak, some have found fault with the museum’s lack of a nod to The Walking Dead. Usually this quibble is abated after visitors are given a chance to wander around in one of those iconic hazmat suits that have for decades signaled the arrival of doom on-screen. As with the suits, and everything inside the museum, the most fascinating — some might say scary — thing about the CDC is that everything they deal with and do is real, no matter how sci-fi it looks, either from a comfortable distance or up-close in Atlanta.',\n",

The standard “beckoning cat” sits in an upright position with one of its paws raised and often mechanically made to wave back and forth. However throughout the years, the Nekos have been adorned with iconic accessories and other flourishes meant to accentuate various specific aspects of the mythical beasts powers, such as longer waving arms to attract more people or holding a coin to hone in on the accumulation of wealth. Countless variations on the traditional themes have been created usually in ceramic or plastic, yet the indelible spirit of the maneki-neko always remains intact.  Ohio’s Lucky Cat Museum collects any and all iterations of the icon in a small art space that is still used for creation in the museum’s off season. rows and rows of lucky felines line the walls and glass cases. Some come with extra arms, while some can wave and others are molded into place. In addition to the ceramic and plastic cats, wood, stone, and metal versions are also on display. Plush cats, toy cats, and cats decorated by modern artists, any version of the lucky kittens is welcome. Currently the collection holds over 2,000 specimens, but is always growing.The Lucky Cat Museum is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, from 3:00pm-6:00pm.

       "  'Built in 1859, the Old Slave Mart was actually constructed due to a tightening of slavery laws that led to the creation of no-less-horrible private auctions.Although Congress banned participation in the international slave trade in 1808, it did not outlaw the domestic trade in enslaved people of African descent until 1865. During the height of the American slave trade, as many as 35-40 percent of enslaved people passed through Charleston while being forced into labor at plantations across the American South. Traditionally the auctioning of enslaved people took place in public displays along the city’s north side, but in 1856, the city put a stop to the public sale of enslaved people.This did not stop the practice, it simply prompted the creation of private auction houses like the Old Slave Mart. The auction front was built on Chalmers Street and soon became a bazaar of teeming private auction businesses. In addition to enslaved people, the mart also auctioned livestock and farmland. The cruel and inhumaneindustrycame to an end when the Union army occupied Charleston, and over the years all of the auction houses except forthe Old Slave Mart were dismantled.In the years following the city’s initial emancipation efforts, the historic building was used as a tenement, a museum, and a car dealership. Today the site hosts a museum devoted to remembering the history of slavery in Charleston. The museum is even staffed by some members who have traced their heritage to enslaved people who were auctioned off in the very building.While similar markets and locations around the country have been repurposed as historic buildings with little to no acknowledgment of their past, the Old Slave Mart faces its relationship to the horrific history of American slavery head on.',\n",

It was expanded in the 1990s and now includes nine collections from around the world. One of the highlights is its vast collection of Native American art, which includes paintings, jewelry, pottery, and traditional woven artifacts and baskets.In addition to the art, the surrounding gardens, both formal and informal, are worth exploring, too.

He likewise presents his thanks to those, who have patronized has design; and any further information of natural curiosities will be very gratefully received.”Steward’s curio cabinet, one of America’s first museums, grew so popular, so quickly, that he moved his operation to a larger building across the street in 1808.

This elusive cryptid was soon dubbed the Mothman and it quickly nestled deep into the American consciousness thanks to a few popular tomes on the encounters.

Presidents George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe are all known to have visited the tavern; Jefferson, a native Virginian, even held his inaugural ball here.Yet despite being host to such prominent dignitaries, Gadsby’s Tavern was frequented by guests of more common means as well. In an era where the average white male earned between $1.00 and $1.50 per day, Gadsby’s charged 50 cents for a meal with beer or cider included. To spend the night at at the inn cost only 20 cents, though guests would have to squeeze together, with up to three people sharing each bed.By the early 1900s, Gadsby’s had been renamed as the City Hotel and Tavern and was no longer seen as the fashionable destination it had once been. Over the subsequent decades, the tavern closed and fell into disrepair. The city began plans to demolish the structure, but it was saved by the local chapter of the American Legion, who repaired the building and used it as their lodge.Today the building operates as both a museum preserving an approximation of what the building looked like in its colonial heyday, and as the Gadsby’s Tavern Restaurant, which serves menu items inspired by what would have been served in the colonial era.',\n",

The installation was created by the English artist Cornelia Parker based on the Bates Motel from Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Psycho(which itself is based on a 1920s painting by the American painter Edward Hopper).While the installation looks like a real house from most angles, it’s actually just a scaled-down facade, with the supporting structure clearly seen from the back just like a film set. The installation plays on the juxtaposition of the familiar and illusory—the wholesome values of the rural farmlands contrasted with the sinister feel of Hitchcock’s horror film.This surprising bit of Americana sticks out like a sore thumb amid the neoclassical architecture of Annenberg Courtyard in Piccadilly.

       "  'What appears to be a simple grass hill in the appropriately named town of Moundsville, West Virginia is actually a prehistoric burial pile known as the Grave Creek Mound.Slowly built over 100 years from around 250 to 150 BCE, the ancient graveyard holds the remains of prehistoric West Virginians and is the largest mound of its kind in the United States. Researchers speculate that the ancient builders of the mound must have moved over 60,000 tons of earth to create the 69 foot tall hill. No small feat for stone age architects.The mound was first discovered in the late 1700’s by English immigrant Joseph Tomlinson who built a house just in front of the mound. Over sixty years after the home was built, Tomlinson’s descendant Jesse began digging tunnels into the mound and in almost no time at all the amateur paleontologist discovered two burial chambers near the center of the hill. Inside the chambers, Tomlinson found skeletons, seashells, and a decent amount of metal jewelry. The enterprising frontiersman did the American thing and opened a museum in the tunnels for which he charged admission.Today the archeological treasure trove has an adjoining museum and research center dedicated to learning all that they can about the prehistoric West Virginians interred in the hill. The Grave Creek Mound is now surrounded by a protective fence that prevents any further destruction due to untrained archeologists, but visitors can still come and take a look at one of the country’s largest piles of ancient remains.',\n",

The Higgins Boat was designed and built in New Orleans, and thus the city became the chosen location for the museum. The museum got its current name in 2006 after an act of Congress two years prior officially designated the museum as “America’s National World War II Museum,” formalized an affiliation with the Smithsonian, and slightly widened its scope.Today the museum retains its focus on military history, skipping ahead two years into the war to focus exclusively on the United States’ involvement via immersive, high-production exhibitions with bombastic titles including Arsenal of Democracy and Campaigns of Courage (housed in buildings with names like US Freedom Pavilion and Hall of Democracy). Military history enthusiasts will enjoy the focus on strategy, troop movement, and weaponry. Other history buffs might bristle at abbreviated timelines and significant omissions from the American experience.Museum highlights include a multi-level observation deck that gives visitors unique views of restored airplanes hanging from the ceiling, and a high-tech, star-studded 4D film “Beyond All Boundaries” playing in the Victory Theater.',\n",

The museum is home to numerous notable artifacts, including the coveralls worn by the only scientist to walk on the moon, the Daisy Track used at Holloman Air Force Base to test the effects of rapid acceleration and deceleration on both mechanical and biological systems, and the Sonic Wind I rocket sled, aboard which researcher John P. Stapp made history as the Fastest Man on Earth. The museum’s Basin Overlook, meanwhile, offers visitors a spectacular view of the facilities where many of these experiments took place.It’s not all about New Mexico, though; the museum is also home to exhibits, such as the Living and Working in Space exhibit, that explore broader concepts of space exploration, as well as the International Space Hall of Fame, established in 1976 to celebrate the achievements of aeronautic pioneers worldwide.One such individual is Ham, the first hominid to be successfully launched into and recovered from space.

Afterwards, Revere rode out from Boston northwest towards Concord to warn of the British Army’s intent to seize a cache of arms and supplies hidden for use by the militia units in the area. This event eventually culminated in the skirmish at the Lexington town green and later the fight at Concord’s North Bridge between American militia and British Regulars, thus beginning the American Revolutionary War on April 19, 1775.The shots fired upon the British by the militiamen at the North Bridge were later immortalized in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1836 poem “Concord Hymn” as the “…shot heard round the world.”',\n",

In 1902, the company began producing automobiles, becoming one of the largest businesses in South Bend. The company thrived for more than a century, producing many cars that became classic icons of American culture thanks to their uniquely decorative designs that echoed art deco opulence. But by the 1950s, the companyfaced financial problems that could not be overcome and the plant closed in 1963, with the last Studebaker automobile rolling off the line of its other remaining factory in 1966.Today the company and the town’s legacy is remembered by the Studebaker National Museum which houses a large collection of over 120 wagons and automobiles, some dating back to Clement Studebaker’s original collection. The Studebaker Corporation donated their collection to the city of South Bend and in 2005, the ultra-modern museum was opened to the public. The collected conveyances track the company’s history through three floors of showrooms. The refurbished vehicles on display include such notable specimens as four original Presidential carriages belonging to such American legends as Abraham Lincoln andUlysses S. Grant, and Fozzie the Bear’s Studebaker Champion used in the original Muppet Movie to take their show on the road.Automobiles today tend to be exercised in function over form, but theStudebaker National Museum lets visitors remember a time when the curves of a car meant almost as much as what was under the hood.

The museum is named for George Glore, who worked for the Missouri Department of Mental Health for most of his 41-year career. A history buff, Glore worked with staff and patients to create replicas of 16th, 17th and 18th-century treatment devices. Hospital officials later encouraged Glore to expand the exhibit into what we see today.While the original 1874 building is now used as part of the city’s prison, four floors of a more recent section of the asylum, along with the once fully operational morgue, now house the museum collection. The collection consists of actual equipment, full-size replicas,and dioramas. Highlights include lobotomy instruments, the Wheel, a wooden treadmill device, and the Tranquilizer Chair created by Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and founder of America’s oldest operating theater.The museum also has artifacts from the other Missouri state hospitals.The museum also includes art done by patients over the years.

Meant to represent the “wild” spirit of the old American West, Jiménez installed the glowing eyes as homage to the neon workshop he worked in as a youth. These glowing eyes have earned the sculpture the nickname “Blucifer.”The sculpture was commissioned in 1993, two years prior to the opening of the airport it stands outside of, but delays postponed its completion. Among these delays was the tragic death of the artist in 2006, when a 9,000 pound portion of the “Blue Mustang” sculpture broke loose and severed one of the artist’s arteries. His sons completed the remaining work.Finally in 2008, the mustang was installed at the entrance to the airport, much to the dismay of the residents of Denver. Public opinion has vilified the artwork with calls from many quarters to have it removed to a less prominent location. City officials have postponed any attempt to remove the work until after 2013 so that residents and visitors can grow accustomed to the statue in hopes that public opinion will soften over time.',\n",

Founded in 1978, the American Museum of Magic has been around for more than three decades, but that’s only a blip in the history of the building in which it resides, an old Victorian structure in Calhoun County, Michigan.Formerly a saloon, a clothing store, and a billiard parlor, the building was constructed in 1868.Spread across three floors of the restored structure, the American Museum of Magic is filled from wall to wall, ceiling to floor, with props from all of the greatest magicians of the 19th and 20th centuries. It’s the largest magic museum in the United States that is open to the public.Half a million pieces of memorabilia are crammed inside of the museum.

One of the highlights is an escape apparatus used by Harry Houdini: his famous Milk Can Escape.What makes the collection most impressive is that it was almost entirely assembled by one man, the late Robert Lund. A Detroit-based writer, Lund was obsessed with magic, but learned early on that he didn’t have what it takes. Instead of embarrassing himself as a failed magician, Lund decided he would become the foremost student of magic history and collect everything related to the art that he could get his hands on.The separate research center for aspiring magicians and historians of magic includes more than one million archived pieces, including a 50,000-volume library.',\n",

       "  'To truly understand the era and the land that the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum celebrates, one need only look at the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 for context.Preparations began well before dawn on April 22, 1889, in the frontier town of Purcell. By the time the sun rose, several thousand homesteaders — men, women, and children — had amassed on the banks of the Canadian River that separated Indian Territory from a swathe of US-government owned land known as Oklahoma. At other points on the border surrounding this area of land, over 50,000 had gathered for the same purpose. Only several metersof water separated them from 1,887,796 acres of unoccupied land, staked out into 160 acre plots and fresh for colonization by the first man who was able to claim it.In Purcell, the bank was lined with prairie schooners, which had positioned themselves at every point along the river where it was possible to ford. Lieutenant Samuel E. Adair and members of the Fifth Cavalry patrolled the bank opposite, warily watching for anyone who tried to get a head start. Anyone who tried to make a move before noon was taken in an armed convoy back to Purcell.By 11:40 am, those who had assembled on the banks before dawn checked their tack for the final time, as Lieutenant Adair stared calmly from the other side of the river. They were first in line to enter the “promised land,” as it had come to be known in the East. It was a warm day in early spring, tempered somewhat by a southerly wind.At noon, Lieutenant Adair looks at his watch, then motions to the soldier on his right. The soldier raises the bugle to his lips, sounds it once, and then steps back out of the way. The cries of thousands of homesteaders rise from the bank as the nervous tension swells and snaps. The first wagons plunge into the water, and the great Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 is underway. By the end of the day, over 11,000 lots would be claimed across the territory. Tent cities of up to 10,000 people would be established next to railway stations at Oklahoma City and Guthrie, where by midnight the towns’ boundaries and main thoroughfares were already staked out.The Oklahoma Land Run was the first of five land runs into unoccupied territory in Oklahoma over the next 16 years. These were lands that had been ceded to the state by Creek and Seminole Native American tribes following the Civil War, and by 1889 were considered some of the most desired real estate left in the West. The events that occurred here on April 22nd embody in many ways the dangerous and pioneering nature of frontier life, which is commemorated at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.The museum itself was opened in 1955 and sits on Persimmon Hill in north-east Oklahoma City, overlooking the expansive lands that were settled here in 1889. Dominating the entrance foyer to the museum is perhaps one of the most impressive works housed in the museum, and indeed, one of the most recognizable of Western art: James Earle Frazer’s “End of the Trail,” cast in plaster and standing at 18 feet high. The rest of the museum follows nobly from this impressive introduction, with a wide range of stylishly laid-out exhibits.The site contains several galleries, including Art of the American West, which displays select paintings and sculptures from the museum’s 2,000 plus collection, including painters such as Charles M. Russell, Albert Bierstadt, and William R. Leigh, as well as sculptures by artists such as Gerald Balcair. Many of these paintings represent, naturally, a romanticized image of the Wild West, but it is one that must have been at the forefront of people’s minds as they moved their livelihoods out here in the mid to late 19th century. Then there is the American Cowboy Gallery, with glass cases exhibiting thousands of objects that help to interpret the cowboy’s history through material culture such as saddles, weapons, and items of clothing. There are also full-scale dioramas of various Western scenes such as a bugle boy galloping across the plains, a seasoned hunter teaching a young man to shoot antelope, and a small cowboy camp with a pot of stew, attached to a trammel, boiling over an open fire. An invitation to a hanging even lurks in one of the displays.Finally, there is Prosperity Junction, a replica turn-of-the-century cattle town, built in the west wing of the museum. At the entrance to the Prosperity Junction gallery, an information plaque states that the replica town is located “somewhere in the west,” but it does not take much imagination to see the early years of Oklahoma City itself, after the Land Run of 1889, when the town was at the frontier of the promised land. In 2020 this area was expanded with an outdoor interactive children’s exhibit called “Liichokoshkomo” (“Let’s Play” in Chickasaw), which celebrates the tribal cultures of the west.Behind the museum in its garden is also an easily overlooked gem: a graveyard for rodeo animals.In 2020, the museum made national headlines as its Head of Security (Tim Tiller) took over all social media accounts and captured America’s hearts with wholesome witticisms and endearing ineptitudes.',\n",

His two museums remain the only skeleton museums in the country. Fortunately, they’re both extensive. Skeletons: Museum of Osteology opened in Orlando in May of 2015 and features over 500 real animal skeletons. Each of these skeletons (and their complex dioramas) was cleaned and articulated by Villamette’s company, Skulls Unlimited International, which is one of the world’s leading providers of osteological specimens and one of the more exciting family-run businesses in Oklahoma, if not in the entire country.Even for experts, bone display is a long and complicated process. It can take hundreds of hours to correctly articulate a full skeleton, and even that follows months of preparation. Skulls Unlimited uses dermestid beetles to clean corpses. While the hungry beetles strip away flesh and tissue methodically and completely, it can take them six months to get through a larger animal. One can imagine how long it took the industrious insects to clean the 14-foot elephant on display in Orlando. (In addition to completed skeletons, the museum also features a small exhibit of the beetles in action.)After the beetles have had their way with a corpse, the bones are bleached in hydrogen peroxide before being assembled by Villamette’s team. For Orlando, they’ve assembled a little bit of everything: monkeys, bats, gorillas. Villamette is particularly proud of the rarer specimens here: There’s a sumatran rhinoceros and two Komodo Dragons. Recently, he told Attractions magazine that if he could acquire one more rare skeleton, he would like for it to be a giant panda. They’re nearly impossible to get ahold of, as the Chinese government keeps such close tabs on the population that even if a panda were to die in an American zoo, the remains would likely be returned. But make no bones about it, even without the dream display, visitors have plenty to see here.',\n",

It is housed in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand’s oldest hospital and medical school, which was established in 1886 and is where the King of Thailand goes when he is ill. The Siriraj is actually comprised of six different museums: a museum of pathology, a forensics museum, a museum of the history of Thai medicine, a parasitology museum, an anatomical museum, and a prehistoric museum.The Ellis Pathological Museum is the oldest of the six museums, founded by the American pathologist Dr. Aller G. Ellis. He collected organs from patients who had been diagnosed with common disorders such as heart disease and cancer, to serve as teaching tools for medical students.The Siriraj’s incredible holdings include bones, preserved organs, pathological fetuses, the mummified corpse of a notorious serial killer, a traditional Thai medicine shop, parasitic worms, a two-and-a-half-foot-wide scrotum removed from a man afflicted with elephantiasis, preserved sections of human skin bearing tattoos, poisonous snakes and tarantulas, rows of skulls, the standing wax-filled remains of a cannibal, a delicately dissected nervous system, and the skeleton of the museum’s founder.A strong stomach is recommended.The Siriraj Museum website has lovely panoramic images of each museum.

       "  'Hugh Mercer was a Scot, a warrior, a friend of George Washington, and a socially acceptable witch doctor who started his own apothecary on the advice of Washington himself.A Scottish war doctor who fled his homeland, Mercer came to America in 1747 to escape loyalist forces who were intent on hunting down the survivors of the Battle of Culloden. After arriving in the North American colonies, Mercer befriended then-Colonel George Washington through their mutual participation in a local Masonic lodge. Mercer opened his rural medicine practice in Virginia in the late 1760s, and Washington’s own mother, who lived nearby, became one of Mercer’s patients. The doctor would go on to fight and perish in the Revolutionary War, but not before leaving behind a trail of historic honoraries including counties, museums, and even his old shop.While the building that holds the museum was not his apothecary, it does date to the same time period. His apothecary was nearby, and historically there was confusion on its exact location. The staff are in period costume and will happily explain the methods and ingredients used in the awkward Colonial version of medicine. The guides are passionate and knowledgeable and will explain in graphic detail, 18th century cures such as blood letting (there are real live leeches available for critical observation), the grittiness of dentistry of the time, and the gruesome details of amputation and surgery during the Revolutionary War.There is also a garden in the back that is still growing the numerous herbs used inside to prepare authentic remedies.The museum is located in Historic Downtown Fredericksburg just minutes away from the Kenmore House, the home of George Washington’s sister Betty, the Mary Washington House, the home of George Washington’s mother, and the Rising Sun Tavern museum, as well as a mixture of antique shops and hipster hangouts which is an appropriate mix of places to accent Mercer’s eccentric piece of American history.',\n",

Very few of the employees, most of whom were women, knew what was being built at the time, or exactly what they were getting into.Delightful Oak Ridge was, in a lot of ways, just like any quaint southern city—there was an abundance of leisure activities like swimming, a library, 13 grocery stores, an orchestra, and swing dancing. Besides the required badges,guard towers and giant perimeter fence, it was practically a wartime Mayberry. Everyone was quarantined, and their duties left the actual project a mystery, but who would want to leave when they have everything right where they’re at, and who were they to question the government who had given them such a comfortable home and stable employment? It wasn’t until Americans dropped the atomic bomb on Japan that the fine citizens of Oak Ridge realized what they had become a part of.Two years after WWII ended, the city was relinquished to civilians. When visiting the city today, you can still see some of the old guard towers on the edges of the city, and experience one of the nation’s largest swimming pools still in operation. For $5 with valid US photo identification, you can go on a tour hosted by the American Museum of Science and Energy which includes the old graphite reactors as well as the Y-12 museum in an operational government facility with a billboard right outside that reminds employees to keep secrets a secret.For a special treat, stop in the museum afterwards to see the brilliant photos of Ed Westcott, the official photographer during wartime.The Secret City Festival, complete with WWII reenactors, happens every June.',\n",

The items, like the tinsmith, advertising, and European cutters, represent different eras and styles in cookie cutting history.It’s believed tin cookie cutters have been used in Europe for centuries. Those who migrated to the United States brought their dessert tools with them, causing the practice of artfully stamping and cutting cookies to gain popularity in the New World. For a time, brands even used the molds to advertise their own goods.Now, cookie cutters are key in shaping some of North Americans’ favorite themed sweets. They transform lumps of dough into fun shapes suitable for any holiday or occasion: pumpkins, stars, snowmen, trees… you name it, there’s a mold for it.Visitors to the National Cookie Cutter Historical Museum will be delighted by its stock of this one beloved baking tool.

John Edward Vandersloot, the founder of the Indian Steps Museum, was an avid collector of artifacts and studied Native American lore.The inscription above the museum’s doorway reads: “I entreat all who pass this way to safely guard and preserve these former possessions of, and monuments to, an ancient Indian people. John Edward Vandersloot, owner and builder. Indian Steps Cabin-1912”And yes, there are “Indian Steps.” They were carved into the river cliffs by the Susquehannock Indians to access the river. They are now, however, hidden deep below the rivers waters after dam construction around 1911.The area is very rich in Native American history and has seen human evidence dating to over 10,000 years ago. The Susquehannocks, “people of the muddy river” (in Algonquin), were an Eastern Woodland tribe. Their numbers dropped drastically due to warfare and disease spread by the European settlers. The last 20 Susquehannocks living together peacefully (in Lancaster County) were tragically massacred by a group of men as a result of a crime committed by an unrelated tribe.

It hits the lofty note, too, of the music of the spheres—there are planets hanging from the ceiling and it’s named after the sound of breath and the sound of mind.The museum is located in Indianapolis’ Fountain Square neighborhood, in the Murphy Building; to reach the museum, you enter into what looks like a very small record store and pass through a heavy red curtain, inspired by the one in a portrait of Charles Willson Peale, the early American painter and collector. Past the curtain is a warmly lit space, just 11 by 10 feet. The display case are made largely from old musical instruments; the collection includes “currencies of amusements and fallen empires,” like the Soviet Union, an ashtray from the Burger King where Elvis was spotted after his death, and samples of dirt from venerated places, including religious pilgrimage sites, places where UFOs were spotted, and the arena where Elvis gave his last performance. There’s also music—the 4th dimension—commissioned for the museum; one piece is inspired by Scapper Blackwell, a blues guitarist who recorded and was killed in Indianapolis.The main attraction, though, is the Parliament Funkadelic Baby Mothership, a prop from the group’s road show. The Baby Mothership flew over approximately 300 audiences: it would appear to land on stage, and the big Mothership would appear, from which George Clinton would emerge. The Parliament Funkadelic road manager Tom Battista is an Indianapolis native, and he and his family were responsible for creating the show’s props. When Kaufmann found out the Baby Mothership was still around, he thought: “That’s too awesome to just have it in storage. We should put it on display and celebrate it.” He had been thinking for a long time about creating a wunderkammer of some kind and recruited artist Kipp Normand as the curator and designer of the project. The Museum of Psychphonics isn’t the sort of place with long, explanatory panels. There’s a pamphlet that visitors can take, but it’s designed to be read after a visit. “The didactic information is pretty limited,” says Kaufmann. “The museum asks more questions than it provides answers.”Update August 2018:The museum temporarily closed on July 22, 2017 to move to a new location. It is still closed as of August 2018.Update February 2019: The museum will reopenFebruary 22 from 6 to9 p.m., and Feb 23 from 12 to 5 p.m. Regular hours for the museum will be on First Fridays and by appointment throughout the year.',\n",

Currently owned and maintained by the State of Nevada as one of its seven state museums the collection focuses on the history of the region as far back as 8000 BCE, though most specifically on the nearby Pueblo Grande de Nevada site the bulk of which was flooded under an arm of Lake Mead. The artifacts here paint a vivid picture of a culture who’s remains in part havebeen literally drowned by history.Originally opened as the Boulder Dam Park Museum in 1935, The Lost City Museumwas built to house the finds being unearthed at the Pueblo Grande de Nevada site, an important site of Anasazi artifacts. As Lake Mead filled with water held back by the newly created Boulder (now Hoover) Dam, the deepening reservoir began to submerge archaeological sites dating into prehistory. It’s impossible to say exactly how much was lost beneath the waters of the man-made lake, but the museum saved what it could by housing both artifacts from excavations of the Pueblo Grande de Nevada site and by collecting donations of artifacts found by local ranchers on their properties. In addition to the wealth of objects displayed inside the museum, the museum’s most iconic feature is a replica Anasazi pueblo cluster built directly on the foundation of an excavated archaeological site from which many of the artifacts were collected.',\n",

In the ensuing years, the brick house on the property (the oldest one in Louisville) became the city’s “pest house,” a site where people suffering from contagious diseases would be housed. As one might expect, this brought with it a fair amount of death.As garden cemeteries were all the rage in Victorian-era America, when the city finally founded the Cave Hill Cemetery it just sort of followed the trend, helped along bya designer who worked to incorporate the contours of the surrounding land into the flow of the site.Since dying was almost its own trend in the late 1800s, the cemetery grew quickly and became the final resting place of a number of influential Americans, including:George Rogers-Clark - A soldier from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War.Nicola Marschall - He designed the original Confederate flag, the Stars and Bars, as well as the official grey uniforms of the Confederate Army.Enid Yandell - An American sculptor who studied with Auguste Rodin and Frederick William MacMonnies.

Situated on a bluff overlooking the Black Warrior River, this archeological site contains a collection of 29 mounds constructed by a Native American society known as the Mississippian culture. The civilization consisted of multiple chiefdoms that occupied an area of land stretching from the Atlantic coast in the east to the Plains region in the west. Each chiefdom operated under its own regional autonomy, both establishing trade networks and engaging in conflicts with neighboring groups.Unlike earlier hunter-gatherer societies, the Mississippian culture developed sustainable agricultural techniques that permitted the formation of permanent settlements. Within these settlements, they developed a complex, stratified society headed by a ruling elite of political and religious figures. It was the members of the upper echelon that supervised the labor-intensive construction of the many mounds, which served as foundations for temples, council buildings, and housing.The chiefdom at the Moundville site grew into a town of as many as a thousand residents between approximately 1000 CE and 1450 CE. The growing influence of the chiefdom is reflected in the mounds themselves, which grew larger and larger. The tallest in the area, known as the Chieftain’s Mound, towers at 60 feet.By around 1500 CE, the area had been largely abandoned. It wasn’t until the beginning of the 20th century that the mounds began to be properly excavated, partially as an attempt to create jobs under the New Deal.

       "  'When we think of castles we think of Europe and Asia, of the towering spires of Neuschwanstein and the massive courtyards and interlocking palaces that populate the Forbidden City. North America is not a continent that has a ton of “castle cred,” mostly because modern North American history (dating from the arrival of white settlers) is, for the most part, a history either of colonies or democracies. However, there is one structure on the North American continent that can truly claim to be a castle, Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City.Chapultepec has the rather dubious distinction of being the only castle within North America to ever house actual sovereigns. It was originally constructed in 1725 on the orders of the Viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez, and was meant to be a large manor house for the Viceroy, who was the commander-in-chief of the Spanish colony, New Spain. During the Mexican War of Independence the castle was abandoned, and remained in a state of dereliction for several decades. It was eventually refurbished and turned into a Military Academy. It was in this capacity that the castle served as the site of the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican-American War in 1847. It was here according to folklore that six (possibly fictional) teenage cadets died defending the castle with one of the boys, Juan Escutia, wrapping himself in the Mexican flag and jumping to his death from the battlements to avoid the dishonor of it being captured by the American invaders.With the rise of the Second Mexican Empire in 1864 the castle became the official residence of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Empress Carlota. Maximilian, while in name and title the Emperor of Mexico, was in fact an Austrian prince of the Habsburg dynasty who was not ethnically Mexican at all, having been offered the crown by Mexican monarchists who were puppets of the French who sought to add Mexico to their empire. During this period the castle began to take on its current floor plan, with Maximilian hiring multiple architects to re-design the castle in the neo-classical style which was popular at the time.Unfortunately for Maximilian his reign, and with it the Second Mexican Empire, were brought to an abrupt halt only four years later in 1867 when the French were defeated and he was shot by firing squad along with several of his most loyal followers. He had been given the opportunity by Juarez to return to Europe but had decided to stay on due to his mothers harsh insistence on him staying and dying with dignity rather than return as a “coward” unworthy of the Hapsburg name. With the establishment of the Mexican Republic under Benito Juárez Cahpultepec again began to fall into disuse and disrepair.Currently the castle is the seat of National Museum of Cultures, which was formerly known as the Museum of Natural History. It was established as such by Lázaro Cárdenas in 1939. In this capacity it is open to visitors who can come and tour both the castle itself and the various collections it now houses. Through the past decades it has become a favorite location of movie directors appearing in both Robert Aldrich’s Vera Cruz and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet.',\n",

Nestled in the Alabama Hills of the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountain range, Lone Pine has served for almost a century as a destination for Hollywood filmmakers seeking sites for exotic location shooting.Starting in 1920 with the Western film The Round-Up,Lone Pine and its environs have appearedas the backdrop for genre classics starring Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, and John Wayne as well as less successful revisionist Western fare like Kevin Costner’s The Postman and 2013’s box office bomb The Lone Ranger. The landscape has also doubled as the Himalayas in films like 1939’s Gunga Din, Spain in 2000’sGladiator,and evenouter space in science fiction movies like Rocketship X-M from 1950 and Star Trek V from 1989.The Beverly and Jim Rogers Lone Pine Film History Museum celebratesthe Hollywood history of the region. Within the museum, the history of film at Lone Pine becomes a stand in for a broader history of Hollywood and the Hollywood Western. It traces the evolution of the genre through big stars like John Wayne and singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. It recounts the movement of the genre from Tom Mix silent films and big screen epics like Rio Bravo to B-Westerns like Gene Autry’s The Train to San Antone and more recent efforts like Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained.It also narrates the genre in terms of the development of technology from the coming of talkies in the 1920s to the coming of television as a domestic medium in the 1950s. These stories are told simultaneously through authentic screen-used artifacts, movie posters, and children’s toys among other objects.As much as the museum outlines the history of a Hollywood genre and a history of media technology, it also maps broad currents of American history. The Western genre is a history of manifest destiny and the settlement of the region by white pioneers, but these films have also served as allegories of current events, and the museum bears this out too.This is especially evident in films of the 1950s that began to deal with developments in American culture like postwar alienation, Cold War paranoia, and, in the case of Bad Day at Black Rock, the Japanese internment that occurred during World War II. However, the museum also makes historical contexts evident when it looks at the genre’s representation of Asian and Arabic people through Edward Said’s concept of orientalism. This idea shows how westerners construct non-white people through racist depictionsof savagery and primitivism.At the Lone Pine Museum, visitors are encouraged to both tour the galleries and venture out into the hills and onto the locations themselves. This is, as the museum’s slogan argues, “where the real West becomes the reel West.” Indeed, the site intentionally juxtaposes fictional narratives with real spaces, highlighting the ways in which places are simultaneously fixed and mutable as they represent both one hundred years of American history and futuristic science fiction.The museum thus teaches us how to see both time and space in new ways — ways that blend the past, the present, and the future through tangible objects and material geographies.',\n",

       "  'In the mid-1800s, travelers moving up and down the Hudson River would have been witness to an abnormal sight: Mayan ruins and artifacts nestled a thousand improbable miles north.When settlers arrived on the American continent, everything seemed new, untouched to them. This sense of an open book lent the land its air of manifest destiny, of fertile fields and virgin forests. That the ‘new world’ was used or inhabited at the time was of no consequence.Though this was the prism through which romantics and schemers viewed their new home, many felt something of an inferiority complex toward the antiquities of Europe. The Hudson River School painters liberally sprinkled ruins into their landscapes, imagining an American past more like that of their own ancestors. Presented with stunning vistas, these artists still wanted something more.John C. Cruger, who owned the island on the Hudson that now carries his name, decided to make this into reality. He partnered with John Lloyd Stevens, a travel writer who penned several books about his travels to eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America, to make it a reality. In 1840, while in Honduras, Stephens purchased the land containing the ruined city of Copan for $50, and took casts of the collapsed buildings and sent them north. They were assembled in New York, artifacts from Copan, Palenque and Quirigua placed among them, and Cruger would show them off to his guests by taking midnight boat rides, moonlight glancing off the impossible antiquities.Following Cruger’s death, the family fell on hard times, and in 1919 the ruins and statues were sold to the American Museum of Natural History, where they are today viewable as “Red Hook’s ruins” in the Hall of Mexico and Central America, having taken something of a circuitous route to arrive there.',\n",

       "  '“To collect, preserve, interpret, and display the artifacts and history of the information age.”That is the mission of the American Computer Museum, founded by husband and wife George and Barbara Keremedjiev. Although the computer has worked its way into nearly every facet of daily life, the American Computer Museum is one of only two museums in the U.S. dedicated to the history of the computer (the other being the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley).For many people, the esoteric language and pervasive status of computers creates confusion and an apprehension towards technology. George Keremedjiev therefore aims to demystify the machine by showing its evolution as a natural extension to human development.Visitors to the museum are guided through a 20,000-year timeline detailing the origins and history of the information age. From the ancient writing system of the Sumerians to early versions of the calculator, the Keremedjievs connect key historical developments to weave an intricate tale of how the computer was born and subsequently changed the course of civilization.The collection started with one mechanical calculator that was purchased in 1980. Soon, the Keremedjievs had acquired so many computing artifacts that a museum only seemed logical. Even today, with 6,000 square feet of floor space, the museum can only manage to display about six percent of its entire collection. Still, over 1,000 items are on view, including an operator’s switchboard, Montana’s oldest telephone and calculator, antique office appliances, Arithmometers, adding machines, and dozens of mainframes and personal computers.Some machines can’t be displayed because they are simply too large. The Burroughs model 205, for example, is a 60-foot-long and 6-foot-deep computer made in 1956, now sitting in the Keremedjiev’s storage. On the other hand, the IBM 1620 from 1964 might fit the space just fine, but at 1,200 pounds it isn’t likely to move anytime soon. Perhaps the museum’s most famous machine, however, is an early version of the Apollo guidance computer, the instrument that helped land men on the moon. On loan from the Smithsonian, this computer was cutting-edge in the 1960s but operated on only two kilobytes of RAM – about as much memory as a musical greeting card.The Keremedjievs also ensure that the people responsible for some of the very machines in their collection get the proper recognition. Since 1997, the museum has annually honored important, but often forgotten, innovators of technology with the George R. Stibitz Computer and Communications Pioneer Awards.The honorees typically travel to Bozeman to accept their award and speak to the public about their careers. Past recipients have included the inventor of the cell phone Martin Cooper, the creator of the compact disc James Russell, and Ralph Baer the inventor of the first home video game.',\n",

The giant coin, which is among the world’s largest wooden nickels, stands just outside The Old Time Wooden Nickel Company and Historical Museum in San Antonio, Texas.Built by Herb Hornung, a former Air Force officer who owned the company and museum, the wooden nickel measures 13 feet, four inches in diameter and weighs 2,500 pounds. The obverse shows a traditional American Bison or American Buffalo and the reverse is dedicated to the men and women who serve in the United States Armed Forces.Hornung purchased the pre-existing company in 1995 and renamed it the Old Time Wooden Nickel Company. He designed and built the large nickel because he loved his shop and knew patrons would be able to see the colossal coin from the road. Hornung passed away in 2008, but the company and museum are still running strong.Inside the museum, visitors can see original wood nickel printing presses, related tools and antiques, and hundreds of wooden nickels on display. Some date back to 1948, when Elbee Co. first opened its doors and started manufacturing wooden nickels as novelty items.In addition to proudly displaying the coin, the museum’s current owners produce wooden nickels for schools, churches, businesses, and clubs all over the world. They support American workers by using only domestically grown wood that is milled in the U.S. Visiting is free and if you ask very nicely, you may get a free wooden nickel—that one you can actually put in your pocket.',\n",

The building now houses the Harriet Beecher Stowe, Slavery to Freedom Museum, but also goes by the name of the Marshall Key House. This early antebellum home would play a significant role in American history.The home was built in 1807 by Eli Metcalfe and in 1815, Metcalfe sold the home to Marshall Key. Marshall Key was the nephew ofthe firstSupreme Court Justice of the United States, John Marshall.In 1833, a young teacher by the name of Harriet Beecher (before she was married and became Harriet Beecher Stowe),came to Washington, Kentucky to stay with her pupil, Elizabeth Marshall Key at the Marshall Key house. One day, Mr. Key, escorted Ms. Beecher down to the courthouse lawn where a slave auction was in progress. Ms. Beecher becameso distressed over the horrible spectacle of the slave auction that she never forgot what she saw. In fact, this event affected her so much, that it inspired her almost 20 years later to write her anti-slaverybook, Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852). Uncle Tom’s Cabin went on to not only become the second best selling book of the 19th centuryin America, but her book sparked the beginnings of events that would lead to the American Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln said upon meeting her, “So this is the little lady who started the big war.”The Marshall Key house is now the Harriet Beecher Stowe, Slavery to Freedom Museum. The house has been restored to the time period in which Harriet Beecher Stowe visited it in 1833. The museum houses artifacts from the American Civil War and slavery.',\n",

       "  'London’s Horniman Museum has been showing off its unique collections since 1890.Focusing on anthropology, natural history and incongruously, musical instruments, the Horniman artfully displays its eclectic collections as though you are wandering through a living science book.The museum was founded by philanthropist Frederick John Horniman who had used the proceeds from his world-famous tea company to travel the world and amass a wondrous collection of artifacts, instruments and anthropological oddities. Eventually, Horniman’s collection overtook his home and he opened the house to the visiting public. The tea magnate continued to collect and in 1901 the current museum and gardens were opened, and have been attracting visitors as diverse as the collection itself.Special care has been given to the Horniman’s display method which uses the various items to create 3D diagrams and charts to better contextualize the importance of the various bones, relics, and specimens. In addition to the stacks of glass-cased displays, the facility also features an aquarium replete with live jellyfish, seahorses, stingrays, Tropical marine fish, Tropical Amazonian fish, and poison dart frogs.Today the Horniman Museum holds over 350,000 objects and continues to grow. Among the taxidermy collection, you’ll find some poignant specimens of now-extinct species, such as the passenger pigeon and the HawaiianHuia. (Somewhat ironically the Victorian obsession with taxidermy collections contributed to the extinction of the latter.) There’s even a sinister-looking specimen of a “Japanese mermaid,” an elaborate fake created in the 19th century.The most famous object, however, is definitely the overstuffed walrus that sits proudly on a fake iceberg (Victorian taxidermists didn’t realize that a walrus would have wrinkles).The building from the outside is an architectural treasure and was constructed according to the aesthetics of the “Arts and crafts” movement. It featuresa large, ornate clock tower and a Greco-Roman mural. The surrounding gardens are beautifully maintained, with a fern garden containing prehistoric-looking plants, a sensory garden, and even a petting zoo with South American llamas and African Pygmy goats. Depending on the weather, you may also have a fine view of the city from the museum’s gardens—if it isn’t too cloudy, that is.Check the website for some of the museum’s many educational and family-friendly events and take a trip to one of the most immersive museums in the world.

His bosses took the bait and the ACAM was born.Today the ACAM occupies an entire floor of Funspot. At any given time, the collection displays around 180 games from the 70’s and 80’s. The outer walls are tightly packed with pinball machines themed after everything from KISS to the Harlem Globetrotters, while the rest of the floor is lined with row after row of tall arcade cabinets. Vintage games like Tetris, Toobin’, Galaxian, Tron, and Space Invaders are all organized by their publisher, with big signs hanging over the cabinets trumpeting, “Atari,” “Taito,” and “Nintendo.” Each year the museum is also home to the Annual Classic Video Game and Pinball Tournament where gamers from around the globe come and try to beat Guinness-recognized high scores.The museum’s collection of games stops at anything made after 1987, because as Vincent tells it, that is when the focus of video games seemed to shift into more violent, less artful fare. The ACAM also holds a number of games in a storage warehouse and regularly switches titles out, so the gaming experience at is almost never the same twice.

Throughout J.P. Morgan’s nine lives, the feline received birthday gifts from Meijer’s friends such as paintings, a bronze cat statue, and even a recreated American dollar bill with Morgan in place of Washington, and the coda, “We Trust No Dog.” With these pieces already in hand, Meijer began the museum in the bottom floors of his historic 1667 townhouse.While Meijer and his family still live in the upper floors of the old patrician merchant’s house, the public museum rooms display cats of all species and hue, depicted in a variety of mediums from paintings and sculptures to posters and books. While a cheeky collection such as this could be presented as gaudy or tacky, the KattenKabinet is decorated and the artworks displayed in the baroque style of a stuffy classical museum. The classy cat collection has even partnered with such austere establishments as the Museum Van Gogh, Amsterdam to present works of both artistic and feline importance. And like any true collection of art, the KattenKabinet released a catalogue of their works called the “Cat-a-Logue.”Of course the KattenKabinet would be nothing without some live specimens to wander the stoic halls and fill the space with a unique feline aroma. To that end Meijer owns no less than five cats that roam the museum and greet visitors. This museum is more fascinating than a ball of string covered in catnip. ',\n",

Hayes took pride in cruising Memphis in the tricked outCadillac Eldorado. As he worked as both a record producer and an in-house songwriter at Stax, which was then a record label in the former theater on McLemore Avenue, it may have even visited the current museum.Unfortunately, Hayes went bankrupt and lost the car. Stax itself shut down in 1976, although it leftbehind an influential legacy in music recording with artists like Otis Redding and Albert King. However, when the building reopened as a museum in 2003, Stax and the Hayes Cadillac were reunited.The museum also includes a fantastic array of soul music artifacts, from a 1906 Mississippidelta gospel church preserved in its entirety to the dance floor from Soul Train.',\n",

This combined with untreated appendicitis doomed Houdini, and he died in the arms of his wife, Bess.2,000 people attended his funeral, after which he was interred in a family plot in Machpelah Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Glendale, Queens. Yet before he died, he left behind instructions to those close to him that were to be his messages from the beyond if heard in a seance. The tradition of the Halloween seances started with his wife Bess, yet even after her own passing (Bess, despite having a tombstone next to his, was actually not buried with Houdini as she wasn’t Jewish and her death date on his tombstone remains blank) the seances continued.The first “Broken Wand” ceremony, a ritual honoring a deceased magician, was performed by the Society of American Magicians, at Houdini’s grave in 1926. It was originally performed on Halloween, the date of Houdini’s death, but the crowds became too large and attracted vandals and partiers, so the ceremony was moved to November, and police now patrol the cemetery on Halloween.There has long been tension between the cemetery and theSociety of American Magicians who also run the Houdini Museum in Scranton. The magicians have accused the underfunded cemetery of selling of pieces of the gravesite, and generally letting things fall into disrepair and the cemetery has accused the magicians of bringing in the vandals that have done damage to the gravesite.Houdini’s grave itself is set amongst other members of the Weiss family, leading up to a monument of a granite bench where a woman stoops in mourning below a bust of Houdini that looms up over the emblem of the Society of American Magicians.The bust has been stolen or destroyed four times between 1975 and 1993. The original wasgladlydonated to the Museum of the City of New York by wife Bess, but the replica was smashed by sledge hammer in 1975, replaced and then stolen in 1983, only to be recovered in 2003.It was most recently replaced in 2011 by a group from theSociety of American Magicians calling themselves the Houdini Commandos who made a replica bust (cast from one of the other replicas) and installed it in a guerrilla restoration operation. The bust is believed to be the sole graven image found in the Jewish cemetery.',\n",

Nearly all of these stained glass works were collectedfrom Chicago-area buildings. It contained a variety of themed items, both secular and not, illuminated mostly with artificial light, highlighting the colors and intricate details of each piece.Rather than placing the museum in a lofty part of town, the stained glass was exhibited on Navy Pier, a popular tourist site. Admission was free, and patrons encouraged get closer to the works and even bring food into the galleries.The Smith Museum closed in 2015. The museum was replaced by the Richard H.

It was primarily focused on displaying works by Louis Comfort Tiffany of the secular variety, and some from associated businesses between 1890 and 1930, collected by the Chicago businessman.Some stained glass from the Smith Collection can be seen in the underground pedestrian walkway at Macy’s on State Street. The Driehaus Tiffany glass collection has returned to the Driehaus Museum on 40 West Erie.

And there’s no better place to rest and reflect on the country’s history than at the Mitsitam Cafe inside the National Museum of the American Indian. Overlooking a curving pool and waterfall, the museum cafe has five food stations, each dedicated to serving food from the Great Plains, Mesoamerica, Northern Woodlands, Northwest Coast, and South America.Enjoy a green chile–infused fry bread with a Puebloan posole. Or, indulge in bison burgers from the Great Plains, while watching chefs cook cedar-planked juniper salmon in a built-in fire pit in the cafe’s partly-visible kitchen. Thanksgiving comes early for vegetarians, who can enjoy cranberry-infused roasted gourds, mushrooms and cornmeal, and blueberry cheesecake. The cafe’s Navajo executive chef, Freddie Bitsoie, combines his background in cultural anthropology and art history with his expertise in the culinary arts to come up with a menu that features both Native American foods and contemporary dishes made with indigenous ingredients.Many ingredients for the cafe’s dishes come from tribal food co-ops or companies. A large portion of the meat comes from the InterTribal Bison Council, a non-profit organization of 57 American Indian tribes that collectively tend to more than 15,000 bison in South Dakota. Mitsitam uses 250,000 pounds of the meat every year to make chili, burgers, and meatloaf, among other delicacies.The interior design of the cafe follows the thoughtful architecture of the museum as a whole, keeping indigenous design elements in mind. A 20-foot totem pole carved by Nathan Jackson, a Tlingit artist from Ketchikan, Alaska, forms the cafe’s centerpiece. Mitsitam also contains a tribal newsstand where visitors can read the latest about indigenous tribes from Native-owned publications across the United States.',\n",

       "  'Sit-ins protesting racist policies throughout the American South weren’t uncommon by 1959. There had been several across the South in response to the policy of segregated lunch counters, so the now-famous sit-in at the Woolworth department store’s counter in Greensboro, North Carolina was by no means the first. It was, however, a catalyst. This protest, which lasted five months, sparked other movements for racial justice across the country. Today, the protest is memorialized at the International Civil Rights Center and Museum housed in the former Woolworth building. For the four Black university students at Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, the question wasn’t if they were going to stand against discrimination, but when. “At what point does a moral man act against injustice?” recalled Franklin McCain, one of the “A&T Four,” in a 1977 oral history of the sit-in. That point came on February 1, 1960. The four students—McCain plus Joseph A. McNeil, David L. Richmond and Ezell A. Blair Jr.—all freshmen at the university, had become close during their first year of college, and often spent nights talking about the ways they could challenge the nation’s racist policies. The night before their historic act, the men had challenged each other to turn talking into action, and the plan was formed. The men entered the store in the late afternoon, purchasing merchandise in the store before heading to the counter. They went to the lunch counter, sat, and then ordered, knowing that this simple act of ordering coffee and doughnuts could mean personal harm. The four students were, as expected, denied service but they stayed seated at the counter until the store closed. When they returned to campus, they recruited other students to join them in another protest. The next day, the four returned this time with nearly 30 more students. The group sat at the Woolworth’s counter from 11 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon, quietly sitting un-served while being shouted at by white patrons. The next day more than 60 students came to protest, the day after that, nearly 300, each day a new refusal, a new threat of violence and arrest. By the end of February, sit-ins had spread to more than 30 cities in eight states. When the protests ended on July 26, 1960 with the desegregation of the Woolworth’s counters, more than 70,000 people had participated in sit-ins across the country, and more than 3,000 people were arrested. This one protest in small-town North Carolina was a significant moment in civil rights history, and paved the way for many of the decade’s fights for racial justice.The International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which opened in 2010, preserves the story of the the A&T Four and the thousands of civil rights heroes, named and unknown, who fought for equality in the United States. The museum has kept part of the historic counter in the space (part of it was sent to the Smithsonian), so that visitors will “never forget the courage displayed by four young North Carolina A&T State College students.”In remembering the first day of the protests, McCain said, “Nothing has ever happened to me before or since that topped that good feeling of being clean and fully accepted and feeling proud of me.” ',\n",

Haley Blvd.“The real characteristic of absinthe is that it leads straight to the madhouse or the courthouse. It is truly ‘madness in a bottle’ and no habitual drinker can claim that he will not become a criminal.” - Henri Schmidt, a French Absinthe Prosecutor.It was August 28th, 1905 and Jean Lanfray drank five litres of wine, six glasses of cognac, two crème de menthes, and one coffee laced with brandy. However, it would be his last two drinks of absinthe that would make the headlines. When Mrs. Lanfray refused to polish the incredibly drunk Monsieur Lanfray’s shoes, he shot and killed his pregnant wife and their two children, and then shot himself in the head. Incredibly, he was found the next day, conscious, hunched over the bodies of his family. Clearly this had been the work of “The Green Fairy”.“The Absinthe Murders” as they were known, would be the last straw for the light green liquor. With the temperance movement going into full swing and absinthism (a concern about the effects of absinthe distinct from just alcohol) and alcoholism fusing into one idea, it was only a matter of time. The United States in 1912 and finally in France, 1915.In New Orleans, the “little Paris of North America,” absinthe was a large part of the culture. The Absinthe Museum in New Orleans is the “only museum of its kind in the U.S. being solely devoted to the preservation and education of absinthe,” explores this connection as well as the general history of absinthe.Divided into a “pre-ban” and “post-ban” room, the pre-ban area shows off the sheer amount of fancy paraphanalia associated with absinthe such as “100’s of absinthe spoons and glasses, numerous antique fountains, saucers, balanciers, brouilleurs, spoon and sugar holders, game pieces, absinthe bottles” as well as artwork related to absinthe.The post-ban room is focused on the re-emergence of absinthe in other parts of the world after the American and French ban on the liqueur. One of the most interesting displays shows “close samples of various herbes used in the distillation process, as well as a step-by-step instructional layout explaining how absinthe is made.”The museum is located only a few blocks from the Old Absinthe House, the original New Orleans absinthe bar. Traditional absinthe was recently re-allowed into the United States, though they must be low-thujone or thujone-free (thujone being a wormword extract, though it has been shown that thujone was not an “active ingredient” in traditional absinthe’s), such as the French Lucid Absinthe Supérieure.',\n",

After it was lost in a card game around 1914, the new owner changed its name to the Navarre, in honor of Henry of Navarre, a king of France known for decadence, and turned the place into a dining club.Art collector William Foxley bought the building in 1983, and spent $6 million turning it into the Museum of Western Art, which opened in ‘86, but it didn’t go well and Foxley was forced to sell some of his most important paintings in the early ‘90s. The museum closed in 1997.That same year, the Anschutz Corporation took over and refurbished and redecorated the place. Philip Anschutz began collecting paintings depicting the American West in the 1960s. His massive collection of paintings has been housed in the historic building ever since, but the Anschutz Collection wasn’t open to the public until 2010.',\n",

       "  'The secret communications work of the Marine Corps during World War II was declassified in 1968, but it wasn’t until 1989 that the first memorial was dedicated to the encryption specialists now famously known as the Navajo Code Talkers.The enormous sculpture is prominently positioned at the corner of Central Avenue and Thomas Road in midtown Phoenix, and sculptor Doug Hyde chose to represent a Code Talker in traditional attire carrying a traditional communications device: a flute.Serving in the Pacific in every major battle of the war, the Code Talkers used their notoriously difficult language as the basis for a code that was never broken. But Navajo was neither the first nor the only Native American language to be used by the U.S. military for wartime communications. Cherokee, Comanche, and Choctaw tribal members were deployed in World War I and, together with Seminole, Assiniboine, and others, they continued to work throughout World War II. More Native Americans have served in the U.S. military per capita than any other ethnic group, and their efforts were central to success in combat.Hyde, whose own heritage is Nez Perce, Assiniboine, and Chippewa, is a veteran himself of the Vietnam War. A master in stone as well as bronze, he has pieces in major museums throughout the United States, including at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. And while his memorial is distinctly Navajo, Hyde’s intention was to include symbols that would be understood by all Native American tribes.ThePhoenix memorial imparts the spirit of the Navajo Code Talkers by depicting a young boy with a flute, representing the communication of peace rather than war. The absence of military garb and the emblematic radios emphasizes that the new generation of Native peoples will live in peace as a result of the sacrifices of the Code Talkers.It is believed that fewer than 10 of the 400 Code Talkers who served in the 1940s are still alive today.',\n",

But the Museum of Mourning Art at Arlington Cemetery categorizes the motifs that are present throughout American art dealing with death and loss.Although it is sponsored by Arlington Cemetery, the Museum is actually modeled after Mount Vernon, George Washington’s famous home. This was done specifically because George Washington’s death influenced the representation of death in art. Following his death in 1799, American art began to reflect the collective loss of the revolutionary leader.Besides art displaying the motifs of angels, wreaths, and lambs, the museum also holds some artifacts related to mourning, including funerary outfits and horse-drawn hearses. One of the most unique artifacts in the museum is the cemetery gun, which was created to prevent intruders in graveyards. The gun was rigged to fire if intruders set foot in the cemetery when they were not allowed. This old-school and extremely deadly security system was abandoned due to its barbarism, and the museum holds one of the few remaining cemetery guns in the world.Update: The Museum of Mourning Art permanently closed in 2016.',\n",

Why, New Orleans of course.The first official cocktail, a little libation that went by the name “The Sazerac,” was a concoction of French brandy, water, sugar and bitters, and was allegedly dreamt up by a man named Antoine Peychaud in an apothecary shop in New Orleans’ French Quarter. The legend of the early mixologist and his signature drink lives on to this day, the spread of the story encouraged by the tourist industry and state legislature (The Sazerac is New Orleans’ official cocktail) but like many things in this mysterious city, the tale has some smoke and mirrors, and facts have been… embellished.It’s a little strange for the curators of the Museum of the American cocktail to deny the fact, especially when they have a newspaper clipping from 1806 that contains the first use of the word ″cocktail″ in America, which is considered the a holy relic for mixologists and cocktail affecinados. However, one of the curators of the museum, Phil Greene, is a direct descendent of Antoine Peychaud. While he believes that his crafty relative Peychaud was quite the clever fellow, it would have been impossible for him to invent the cocktail in 1806 since he was only three at the time.However and wherever the cocktail originated, the Museum of the American Cocktail has been recording and celebrating the history and evolution of the cocktail through the years. The museum was originally a traveling exhibit going from New York to Las Vegas, but it finally found a permanent resting place inside of the Southern Food and Beverage Museum on Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. The museum contains a variety of cocktail and bar memorabilia from antique cocktail shakers, cups, and bottles, to pro- and anti-prohibition propoganda.While it might seem like a place where you could get a drink, the museum does not have a bar on the premises.

Exhibits on display include a phrenological machine that gauges personality by measuring the size of bumps on the head and glasses and soap products designed for weight-loss.You can still have your phrenology read by the fully functional machine today, and as the machine outlines the bumps on your skull, the phrenology reader “maps” intelligence, morality, and much more. Machines such as these were all the rage at State Fairs of the early 1900s, as were other questionable medical devices. The infomercials of their time, these snake oils and pseudoscience gadgets could cure impotence, tell how smart you were, and make you live forever.Unfortunately, these contraptions were also often dangerous to the public that was tricked into using them. A depilatory machine removed unwanted hair with x-rays and ultimately caused cancer in the thousands of women who paid for the treatment. Another apparatus, used in shoe stores, allowed you to see your feet in your new shoes with an x-ray machine. How else could you tell if the shoes fit? The machine was declared unsafe by the FDA in 1970.The museum’s roots lie in a modern-day “phrenology parlor” started by Bob McCoy in the early 80s. Bob and his friend acquired a dozen or so phrenology machines and opened up shop in a waterfront mall in downtown Minneapolis. Demonstrating the machinery for a few bucks a pop, word soon spread about McCoy and his vintage devices. McCoy continued to acquire additional pieces from garage sales and other collectors, and the exhibit now also holds exhibits on loan from The American Medical Association, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, The St. Louis Science Center, The Bakken Library, and The National Council Against Health Fraud. When McCoy retired, he donated his collection of more than 325 exhibits to the Science Museum of Minnesota.The museum is currently the world’s largest display of “what the human mind has devised to cure itself without the benefit of either scientific method or common sense.”',\n",

Opened in 2011, the shiny ethereal building cost $70 million to build, but resulted in a chic complex of galleries accessible through a narrow entrance in the building’s front.Quite fittingly, considering the magical appearance of the museum, it was Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Colombian novelist, author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, and founder of the magical realist literary movement, who cut the ribbon during the opening ceremony.Although the museum was a donation from Carlos Slim, each part of its construction was an inside job. His son in law, Fernando Romero, designed the massive structure and the exterior is covered in 16,000 hexagonal aluminum tiles from an aluminum plant Carlos Slim owns. The entire structure coyly enriches Mexico City’s cultural landscape while padding the pockets of the museum’s benefactor.While the modern architecture of the Soumaya Museum has drawn praise for its ingenuity and partnership with Frank Gehry, many have also derided the building as an eyesore. One critic even went as far as to attack Carlos Slim, saying that money can buy everything, except taste.

After a good many changes in the profile of the tower, roofs, etc., a plaster of Paris model was made to scale, and used until the building was completed.”Finished to Mercer’s exact specifications in 1912, Fonthill remains an ornate, architecturally unclassifiable mansion constructed entirely out of poured concrete.Besides being an archaeologist, Mercer was a self styled anthropologist, ethnographer, and perhaps most importantly, collector. When Mercer began to collect artifacts for his museum, his aunt informed him that she had a vast collection of medieval armor. Mercer was delighted, as he wanted the Mercer Museum to contain not only relics of American history, but world history as well. The armor was kept in storage in Boston while Mercer continued to collect. But the storage building was made of wood, in the year 1872, the Great Boston Fire destroyed much of the city, and all of Mercer’s armor.Devastated, Mercer realized that he could not risk fire erasing his collected Americana before future generations could learn from them, and concrete was his answer. The people of Doylestown thought he was crazy, spending years immersed in building his concrete castles, but Mercer had the last – possibly crazed – laugh when, years later at the completion of Fonthill, he climbed to the very top terrace and built a huge bonfire, high enough for all of Doylestown to see. Fireproof.Today Fonthill displays evidence, both inside and out, of a reason to Mercer’s madness (including a professed “unbending hostility to ugliness and false taste”), although the architectural rhyme and reason—dormer placement and roof pitch, 32 staircases balanced by only eight bedrooms—are only fully understood by Mercer himself. Ornamentally the same holds true: vaulted ceilings are decorated with glittering inlaid tiles taken from Mercer’s factory and personal ceramics collection, despite the walls remaining untouched by paint.Among Mercer’s collection held at the Mercer Museum (located close to but separate from Fonthill), are the everyday tools and things of the average American in the 18th and 19th centuries, from a watchmaker’s gears, to the wares in a tortoiseshell comb maker’s shop, butcher’s instruments, even a whaler’s boat. Keep your eyes out for the fake, but neat looking, vampire hunting kit.The often mentioned haunting of Fonthill’s woods adds a bit of paranormal flair to an already eccentric establishment, though Mercer no doubt would have found it gauche to have the former housekeeper terrorizing his evening guests.',\n",

Funding for this insanely large project was provided by art dealer Virginia Dwan, who would go on to donate the deed to the property on which Double Negative is located to Los Angeles’ Museum of Contemporary Art in 1969, just before the piece was officially completed.Raised by an archaeologist father, throughout his career, Heizer has long taken interest in working in the dirt. He consistently ranks among the upper echelon of the “Land Art” artists, with peers including Robert Smithson. Yet, unlike some of the more famousearthworks of his contemporaries, Double Negative is the kind of piece that is so understated, and so esoteric despite its size, that while tourists from all over the world will flock to see it in-person, most locals don’t even know it’s there.It consists of two massive trenches dug at right-angles into the landscape. Today theseangles are a little less crisp than they used to be, thanks to time and erosion, but Heizer wishes that no repairs be made on the piece, instead favoring the Earth’s eventual reclamation of it. These trenches span a natural chasm, but when viewed head-on, they line up directly, tothe effect of extending the sky downward into the earth itself.

One quiet April morning, in 1906, a San Francisco filmmaker took what was then a relatively new invention, the motion picture camera, and shot a mild, unassuming film of his city’s bustling downtown.Just a few days later, those same buildings tumbled to the ground.The silent film captured that morning reflects some of the final hours of a city that would be forever changed by what would become known as the Great San Francisco Earthquake. It was one of the most devastating natural disasters in American history, and without the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, the touching, quietly moving impact of such a short film likely would’ve been lost forever.The Niles Essanay museum is one of the world’s leading curators and preservers of silent film history, memorabilia, and the films themselves. Inside its walls, classic movie posters hang in frames – illustrations of a different time in both filmmaking and art, and antique silent film cameras stand like sentinels guarding the films and memorabilia.Sifting through the museum’s collections is like sifting through time itself, its pieces remnants of a time so distant now it’s barely a memory.The quaint, box-shaped little building the museum calls home is itself an historic landmark. Once the location of Niles Essanay Studios – prominent producers of silent films in their heyday – the building and its now-dormant production facilities created and distributed many of the most famous silent films of all time.Most notably, the studio produced several of Charlie Chaplin’s iconic films, so much so that Chaplin memorabilia and history is one of the museum’s main draws. In fact, the museum remains a key collaborator in Charlie Chaplin-based projects to this day, ranging from news and print features covering Chaplin’s history to homages, as was the case with a recent “Google Doodle” celebrating the great silent star’s birthday.Today, the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum provides an entertaining window into a vastly different era, but also provides an increasingly important service.

Despite being the birthplace of one of the most enduring figures in American history, even at the time, the home was demolished to make way for retail space in 1916. After his death in 1919, this grave mistake was rectified by a women’s group who set to work rebuilding and recreating Roosevelt’s childhood home in its entirety. Using a neighboring building as an architectural template as well as furniture and design advice from Roosevelt’s widow, the group was able to restore the site to the same comfortable state it was in in 1865.The birthplace still operates today as a living museum that highlights and honors the president’s roots and career. Among the artifacts on display from Roosevelt’s adventurous life is the shirt he was wearing when shot by a would-be assassin in 1912. The once blood-stained shirt, which was washed before it was installed in the museum, is now a lily-white blouse that still shows the hole where the bullet penetrated the president’s chest. Luckily, the projectile was slowed by a steel eyeglass case and a thick, folded speech inside Roosevelt’s jacket pocket. Being one of the manliest men ever to walk the Earth, Roosevelt shrugged off the flesh wound and went on to deliver the speech, despite the huge bullet hole straight through the pages.

However, the iron-bearing ore was not of much use without a place to smelt it, so Johnson and three of his brothers built the Catoctin Furnace to do just that.Construction began in 1774, and the furnace came online in 1776 — just in time to start turning that hematite into cannons and cannonballs for the American revolutionary forces. Thomas Johnson had been a Maryland delegate to the Continental Congress where he was firmly in favor of American independence; thus, his fledgling manufactory allowed him to add a material dimension to the political support he had already lent to the cause. He also served in the Maryland militia and was elected as the state’s first governor in 1777; he later became an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.The location of the Catoctin Furnace was selected for its proximity not only to ore, but also to a stream that could drive the bellows as well as a forest that could supply charcoal. The demand on the forest was intense, as one acre of trees was required to produce a day’s worth of charcoal. The furnace produced pig iron, which served as the raw material for a wide variety of iron wares.A second furnace was built in the 1850s, which also ran on charcoal; a third was built in 1873, which ran on coal. Operations finally ceased in 1903. During the Great Depression, the property was purchased by the Federal Government, and unemployed people were put to work to turn the industrially depleted land into a park. The northern half became Catoctin Mountain Park (home of Camp David), while the southern half became Cunningham Falls State Park (home of Catoctin Furnace).In 1979, a previously unknown slave cemetery was unearthed just outside the Catoctin Furnace. The Maryland State Highway Administration hired a team of archaeologists to investigate the site, where they excavated 35 bodies.Today, the Catoctin Furnace African American Cemetery represents what is thought to be the most complete African American cemetery connected with early industry in the country. More than 100 people who labored at the furnace and in the surrounding community were buried there. Many were enslaved workers, while others were members of the nearby free Black community.In 2021,facial reconstructions were unveiled of two enslaved people who worked at the Catoctin Furnace: a woman in her 30s and a boy about 15 or 16 years old.The busts were created by sculpting clay around plastic reconstructions of the original skulls.The Catoctin Furnace Historical Society maintains the site today, which includes the original structure and a second furnace (nicknamed “Isabelle”) as well as structures from the pre-revolutionary industrial village that sprang up alongside the furnace. A trail connects the museum to the cemetery, where signage is being added withthe names of the enslaved that they’ve been able to find along with other historical information.',\n",

Strict record keeping was not a priority at the museum so the origin of many of the items is nearly unknown, however, this actually works to give the collection an even greater air of mystery.

It represented a departure from high-class art and science museums, catering to a poorer crowd and offering items of a much more dubious nature.Part of the appeal of the dime store museum lay in arguing about what was real and what was a “humbug,” as P. T. Barnum called a hoax or fake display. Feejee mermaids (a type of fake or “gaff” taxidermy made from a monkey and a fish, sewn together to form an incredibly ugly “mermaid”) mixed with real exotic animals, and scientific instruments sat next to a loom run by a dog. Unfortunately, Barnum’s American Museum burned to the ground in 1865.Though many dime museums had disappeared by the 1920s, dime museums such as New York City’s Hubert’s Museum would remain open until the late 1960s. One of the best recreation dime museums, Baltimore’s American Dime Museum, opened in 1999 only to shutter its doors in 2007. So though it may not look like much at first, “Austin’s Museum of the Weird” is, in fact, a rare beast.Created by artist-entrepreneur Steve Busti, the museum lives in the back of his store, the “Lucky Lizard,” and features many of the same types of curios you might have encountered in a turn-of-the-century dime museum, including a feejee mermaid. Among the other items shown are a cyclops pig, a hand of glory (supposedly the dried and pickled hand of a man who has been hanged), a two-headed chicken, shrunken heads, and mummies. Followed by a tour of their very own Wax Museum, then you’ll be ushered into a dark room and shown their special exhibit, “The Minnesota Iceman”, a decades-old mystery.Lastly, you’ll be shown into a theater (where Johnny Depp once stayed) and given a live sideshow performance. A rotating cast means you’ll see “The Black Scorpion” perform a traditional show, John T. Rex hold a live wire in his bare hands, “The Amazing Face” hurt himself, and a three-legged dog. (Note, performers work for tips.)Though more expensive than a dime, the Museum of the Weird happily continues the tradition of the dime store museum.Tickets are $12',\n",

Today, it holds a museum to James’ life and death inside, complete with a bullet hole in the wall that dates back to the shooting.After a life full of criminal activity that made Jesse James famous in his own time, the outlaw eventually attempted to settle down (at least for a while) with his family in St. Joseph, Missouri. Despite being feared and renowned as maybe the most prolific criminal in American history to that point, James was also noted as a husband and father who took great care of his family. Unfortunately, by the time they settled in their Missouri home it was too late for any kind of peace. The $10,000 reward for James’ capture was just too sweet a pot for his accomplices to ignore. Finally, on April 3, 1882, one of James’ former partners in crime, Robert Ford, put a bullet in the back of James’ head right in his own home.When the disreputable Ford brought in James’ body to collect the reward, the authorities actually arrested him for murder. Ford would go on to die in a bar fight a few years later, remembered by few, loved by none. James, however, is still an American icon, and the former home where he was shot has become a museum to his legacy.The museum features artifacts from the James’ life such as one of his old guns and portraits of James. More items were added in the 1990s after James was exhumed to test whether his corpse was in fact his (it was), and now James’ coffin handles and some trinkets he was buried with are also on display. Possibly most interesting is the bullet hole in the wall that dates back to James’ killing. It was originally quite small, but has grown over the years as visitors have fiddled with it.   ',\n",

The Confederate States of America was established in February 1861, but never recognized by any other government or nation. Its constitution legalized and protected slavery. Civil rights advocates have supported the removals, while critics have claimed the city is erasing its history.

Step inside, however, and you’ll be treated to a celebratory tour of the Booze History Museum, several small rooms filled with hundreds of drinking-themed objects from around the world.Upon entering the house, visitors walk through a hall decorated with cautionary tales from temperance movements past. Posters and paraphernalia warn innocents of the evils of intoxication, while a collection of original doctor’s prescriptions for alcohol illustrate the clever ways Americans skirted Prohibition. “You could get a prescription for everything,” says Mezhburd. “Coughing, back pain, bronchitis.” Before the tour begins in earnest, guests must baptize themselves with booze. Mezhburd calls this process “disinfection.” He offers a rack neckties. “Ties and drinking don’t mix,” he says. Then, he escorts guests into the finished basement-cum-barroom, where colorful rows of booze-themed knickknacks from across the world and throughout history overlook a bar sporting every conceivable form of alcohol delivery.First round of “disinfection”: A red spray can, reminiscent of a fire extinguisher, from which he sprays pure vodka into guests’ mouths.Subsequent rounds include small shots, but don’t fear getting too buzzed: For all the alcohol served during the tour, the portions are sensible, and each shot is chased with a snack such as cured fish or a skewered piece of bread, pickle, and salo (cured raw pork fat). If they’re lucky, guests may even get to experience disinfection delivered by a small sculpted donkey, who, with the pull of a switch, sprinkles vodka from its nether regions straight into a cup. Once sanitized, guests are ready for the museum proper, a small sitting room turned full-on gallery on the first floor of Mezhburd’s house.“When you read the literature about drinking, it’s negative,” says Mezhburd. “But I did my own research. Ninety-seven percent of alcohol brings joy, brings happiness, brings people together.” Mezhburd’s collection is certainly joyous. A display case shows kitschy sculptures of people drinking by region, including Northern Europe, Russia, Southern Europe, and Asia. A collection of drunk monks beams merrily from a display case; a wall hung with plates project colorful drinking scenes; and back issues of drinking magazines add a graphic punch.Mezhburd, who immigrated to New York City from Russia in 1989, began his collection by accident: He just liked going to yard sales. Soon, however, his passion for kitsch turned into the full-time focus of his retirement (he was an engineer). Today, he scours the internet for unique additions to his collection, and is seeking an independent space for the collection. For now, the museum is open by appointment only, and Mezhburd often hosts members of New York’s Russian community, as well as visiting Russian artists, for private gatherings. In a nod to this heritage, those lucky enough to snag a visit to the booze museum are likely to find not just a delightful tour, but Russian snacks, a sample of Mezhburd’s homemade horseradish vodka, and plenty of camaraderie.',\n",

Unfortunately it did not last very long and the taxidermalogical assemblage, which included a prestigious antler collection, was closed with the onset of World War II. However, undeterred the museum reopened in 1966 inside of the former Augustinerkloster, a defunctAugustinian abbey that had stood in the city since the 13th century.

But rather than simply protest, Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote to Korczak Ziolkowski, who had assisted in the carving of Mount Rushmore, and asked him to help the local Native American tribes etch their own heroes into rock.In 1948, Ziolkowski began work on a carved memorial to Crazy Horse, a Lakota war hero who fought and died battling the United States government at the turn of the 19th century. The mountain Ziolkowski was given to carve was located a scant eight miles from Mount Rushmore.Though Ziolkowski passed away in 1982, work continues on the Crazy Horse memorial. The face of the sculpture, a towering 87 feet, was dedicated in 1998. When completed, the sculpture will stand 641 feet long and 563 feet tall making it the world’s largest sculpture by far. For a size comparison, the head of Crazy Horse alone is 27 feet taller then the six story heads of Mount Rushmore. In fact, if you were to stack all the heads of Mount Rushmore on top of one another they tower of presidential noggins still wouldn’t reach half the height of Crazy Horse. The horse head alone could easily fit two of Lincoln’s inside of it.Work continues sixty years after Ziolkowski begun and is currently progressing on the horse’s head. In June, the Memorial hosted an open house where people were allowed on the mountain. As many as 15,000 people showed up.Ironically today almost all the local Native American tribes do not support the monument. In the words of Lakota medicine man Lame Deer, “The whole idea of making a beautiful wild mountain into a statue of him is a pollution of the landscape.

       "  'In 1882, the Kingdom of Hawai’i unveiled a new royal residence that was intended to cement the nation’s sovereignty and status as a modern state. A mere 11 years later, it witnessed some of the most dramatic events in the island monarchy’s demise.The site of Iolani Palace had been the seat of royal power in Hawai’i since King Kamehameha III moved the capital from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845. At the time, however, the structure on the premises was called Hale Alii (“House of the Chief”) and was a traditional Hawaiian great house, rather than the European-inspired palace that stands there now. That building was commissioned almost 30 years later, with the ascension to the throne of King David Kalakaua.King Kalakaua was the first Hawaiian king to visit the United States, as well as the first Hawaiian king to travel around the world. Hawai’i’s “Merrie Monarch” known for socializing and entertaining, he was also a vocal advocate for Hawaiian arts and culture, including reviving hula after it had been banned in 1830. When his rule began in 1874, he found the old great house (which had been renamed Iolani, meaning “royal hawk,” by King Kamehameha V in honor of his brother) to be in poor shape and decided that the Kingdom ought to have a palace that would announce its presence in the modern political landscape.The old house was demolished, and the cornerstone for the new Iolani Palace was laid on December 31, 1879. Completed in 1882, the palace is considered the finest example of the Hawaiian Renaissance style of architecture, characterized by a melding of historic Italian forms with Hawaiian elements that produced sleek, well-ornamented facades with delicate columns and wide verandas. In fact, its design is so singular that it earned its own unique appellation: it is the only American Florentine building anywhere in the world.After King Kalakaua died while seeking treatment for kidney disease in San Francisco in 1891, he was succeeded by his sister Queen Liliuokalani. However, her plans to strengthen the Hawaiian monarchy and restrict suffrage to Hawaiian subjects quickly inspired rancorous and potent opposition from Hawaiian-born Americans, naturalized citizens, and foreign nationals. With aid from the American Minister to Hawai’i, the “Committee for Safety” overthrew the government of Liliuokalani and she was forced to yield authority in 1893. A subsequent attempt to restore the monarchy led to Liliuokalani’s arrest, full abdication, and humiliating public trial, in the throne room of Iolani Palace. She was subsequently kept under house arrest in a room on the second floor of the palace for nine months.After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai’i, Iolani Palace served as the seat of power of the ensuing Provisional Government, Territorial Government, Military Governor (while Hawai’i was under martial law during World War II), and finally State Government when Hawai’i was admitted to the Union in 1959. However, Hawai’i’s first governor, John Burns, quickly moved state offices to a different location and undertook a project to restore Iolani to its former splendor. It officially ceased to be the state capitol in 1969, and reopened as a museum in 1978.The museum sought to recreate the environment that existed when Iolani was still an official royal residence, including meticulous recreation of original fabrics and scouring the globe to repurchase original furnishings that were sold at public auction by the provisional government after their successful coup. Visitors can see the original Throne Room, Grand Hall, and State Dining Room, as well as the King’s and Queen’s Suites and the Imprisonment Room, which still features the Queen’s Quilt which Liliuokalani made during her incarceration.',\n",

When viewed from campus, the building presents a largely brick facade that is designed to blend in with the surrounding brick and sandstone buildings. When viewed from the opposite side, though, the Weisman Art Museum displays curving and angular brushed steel sheets that have been an abstract signature of Gehry. (Consider, for example, his Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.) Some critics have warned that the steel sheets could reflect the light of the sun into the eyes of passing motorists on the bridge and cause an unintentional accident.Frederick R. Weisman, the man for which the museum is names, was a Minneapolis native who became famous in the Los Angeles area as a serious art collector before his death in 1994. Weisman’s collection and reach were so large that he founded other Frederick R.

After purchasing an old distillery in Bardstown in 1957, he began filling it with the treasures he acquired, eventually gathering enough memorabilia and collectibles to have his own private museum. Clearly not as enamored with the history of hooch as her husband, Mrs. Getz demanded Oscar clear his whiskey collection out. Reluctantly, he paid the city to restore a 200-year old seminary to act as the new museum, and promptly died soon after it was finished. The Getz family has maintained the museum and kept it free, so that Oscar’s passion for the liquor he loved could be appreciated by all who came to see it.The museum covers a fantastic array of the rich history of American whiskey—rare documents, photos and artifacts showcase its early days as moonshine, its stint as a prescribed medicine, and of course the dark days of prohibition. Whiskey is a versatile booze that walks a thin line between pretentiousness and hobo fare and the museum does an excellent job of showing both the high-brow and low-brow sides of the brown spirit. You can view Lincoln’s liquor license, hundreds of antique bottles, and George Washington’s still.The sheer amount of rare and priceless whiskey bottles (whiskey included) is mouth-watering, and some of the antique and collectible bottles are actually for sale. Unfortunately, if you’re hoping for a sample, keep hoping—the museum has no liquor license. If you want to enjoy the museum’s fare, you must purchase it andimbibe elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'Ross Ward began carving wood in junior high school. His first piece was a miniature wooden circus. Little did he know this was to the first of many thousands of carvings, paintings, etchings, and drawings he would complete in his lifetime. His first subject was a fitting one: Ward eventually gained employment as a carnival backdrop painter and for over 30 years he traveled with the circus, exhibiting his self-taught paintings and carved miniatures around the world.Today a 22-room museum, also built by Ross Ward, is packed with Ward’s art as well as his eccentric collections of American ephemera. The museum itself is a curiosity built out of 50,000 glass bottles. A true labor of love, it took Ward four decades to build, collect and stock the Tinkertown museum. Wagon wheels, old fashioned store fronts, and western memorabilia also make Tinkertown’s exterior as much a part of the museum as the wonders within.Among the many other items the museum features, besides Ward’s art, are thousands of wedding cake couples, antique tools, bullet pencils and much, much more. Other highlights include Otto the one-man-band and Esmerelda, the Fortune Teller (a quarter each) as well as a 35-foot-long antique wooden sailboat that braved a 10 year voyage around the world. It is displayed in the backyard.A testament to just how much one man can accomplish in his life, in the words of Ross Ward: “I did this all while you were watching TV.”',\n",

       "  'For many years, the American circus mesmerized the public with its wild animals, its dazzling starlets, colorful clowns and breath-taking acts. Never before had the American public been so hooked and entranced by such a bizarre entertainment medium. Perhaps the best known circus was the Ringling Bros. Circus (who later merged with Barnum & Bailey Circus). The Ringling Bros. Circus put on its first performance in 1884 in Baraboo, Wisconsin, home of the five Ringling brothers. Today, the Ringling Bros. Circus is the largest surviving circus company.In the 1950s, as the television began to gain popularity, the amount of circus-goers slowly started declining. John Kelly, personal attorney to the Ringling brothers, noticed this decline and proposed a museum that would be dedicated to preserving the golden era of circus and the Ringling legacy.The museum first opened to the public in 1959 in Baraboo, Wisconsin at the original, winter circus headquarters. Over the years, the museum gained another 63 acres. Today the museum exhibits the history of the Ringling Bros. Circus as well as the history of circuses in general. Visitors can find a collection of curious circus artifacts including wagons, ads, posters, journals, oil paintings, hand bills, photographs and much, much more. And the best part? During the summer, the museum houses circus performances.',\n",

       "  'Many people, especially in big cities, view pigeons as flying rats whose primary profession is taking a crap all over the place. Yet pigeons are incredibly intelligent and the relationship between humans and these often shimmering birds is extensive.The American Pigeon Museum honors this long-standing interaction and the simple majesty of the birds themselves. First forming in 1973 as the American Homing Pigeon Institute, the organization was initially devoted to the sport of training pigeons. In 1993, the organization expanded, purchasing ten acres in Oklahoma City where they opened the pigeon museum and the affiliated “World of Wings” pigeon center. The museum gave the institute a place to house and display the ever increasing number of artifacts and memorabilia that it was accumulating from practitioners of the sport and other collectors.In 2013, the museum was expanded into its new facility where it remains today. Among the displays, many of which are named after pigeon researchers and enthusiasts, there are a number of statues, paintings, clocks, ads, and even mounted wings. Most engagingly are the extensive displays on the role of homing pigeons in World Wars I and II. The exhibits honor specific hero birds and there are also a number of military artifacts related to the use of the trained couriers such as message pouches.The museum and library also holds an extensive collection of live pigeons of various breeds so that visitors can see the wide and colorful variety of the birds. They even have flight shows. One visit to the American Pigeon Museum and you’ll start thinking of the term “dirt bird” as a slur.',\n",

       "  'The Renwick Gallery building has the distinction of being the first art museum in Washington D.C., and the first U.S. building purpose-built to be an art gallery. Once known as the “American Louvre,” it is now known as a hub of American craft art.Originally the building that now houses the Renwick Gallery was made to house William Wilson Corcoran’s art collection. However, within a few years the Corcoran art collection outgrew the historic building. The Renwick building (named after its architect, James Renwick Jr.) then became the home of the Federal Court of Claims. In 1965 President Johnson signed an executive order that transferred over the Renwick building to the Smithsonian Institute. After a renovation, the building opened in 1972 as the branch of the Smithsonian American Art Museum dedicated to American arts, crafts and design.Now known as the Renwick Gallery, the building itself is a National Historic Landmark. It was originally modeled after the Louvreś Tuilerries addition and during its construction some referred to it as ¨The American Louvre.¨ While it was a popular and active gallery, The Renwick Gallery was briefly been closed from December 2013 to November 2015 while undergoingrenovation.On November 20th, 2015 the Renwick Gallery reopened, and the first building in the U.S. dedicated as an art museum is now open for the general public to visit once again.

       "  'Located in Madison County, Tennessee, this park’s many geographical features were shaped by ancient Native Americans during the Middle Woodland period (1-500 CE).2,000 years ago, the land that is now the 1,200-acre Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park was a bustling place. During this time, 17 mounds- serving a number ofdifferent purposes- were built in this wooded area, which seems to have been considered sacred by the local people. Some of the mounds were used as burial grounds, some for ceremonial altars, and others as temporary habitation areas. The most famous — “Saul’s Mound” — was probably a ceremonial platform. Researchers believe that the layout of the mounds may have been influenced by astronomical alignment. For example, Saul’s Mound is designed to face the four cardinal directions. There is also an earthen geometric enclosure known as the “Eastern Citadel,” although it was probably also used for ceremonies rather than for protection.Numerous excavations over the decades have uncovered the remains of prehistoric homes, refuse pits, a human cremation pit, and artifacts that lead researchers to believe the area may have been a regional trade center. During the 1980s, six tombs were discovered. One held the bones of eight richly adorned young women, while another contained four older men.Today, the Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park is state run and open to the public. The museum is located in a unique building, designed to look like one of the park’s mounds. According to a director of the park, “We want to share the Native American culture — past and present — with the public, tying in archaeology that helps people to understand more about the Native American culture.” To further this aim, every year the park sponsors Archeofest, a three-day celebration of Native American culture that draws thousands of visitors from all over the state.',\n",

Bastet, a feline goddess, was an important deity in ancient Egypt, most commonly represented by a sitting cat staring straight ahead. A bronze statue of the worshipped feline dating back to 600 BC is one of the highlights of the American Museum of the House Cat, which has hundreds of exhibits dedicated to the beloved species.Founded in April 2017 by the local “Catman” Harold Sims, the museum focuses specifically on the house cat, the domesticated pet. The museum features cat memorabilia collected by Sims over three decades:A petrified cat rescued from a 16th century English fireplace, a hand-carved kitty carousel, antique cat toys, and cat beer steins are all on display.The retired biology professor and his wife Kay set up a no-kill cat shelter in 2002 right next door to their home in Sylva, North Carolina. The museum was conceived as way to share their vast cat-themed collection with feline lovers, document the history of human-cat interaction, and raise money for the shelter. On most days, Sims is at the museum, adding to the unique experience with stories about the exhibits.Update as of August 2020: The museum is relocating to5063 Hwy 441, South Sylva, NC 28779.',\n",

Decorated with pop culture figures, political icons, sports logos, unique commemorative editions, and countless other designs, the sprawling collection of cases on display is impressive in scope.Perhaps the most interesting attraction at the museum however is the “World Famous Zippo Clinic.” True to their promise that “It Works or We Fix It Free,” the clinic has a large viewing window through which visitors can watch the Zippo doctors work their magic. There also a number of unfixable lighters on display with the reason for their destruction listed with such colorful demises as “power mower,” “sledgehammer,” and “taxiing airplane.”The museum is not hard to find thanks to the giant Zippo attached to the sign outdoors, which lights up with a neon flame.',\n",

       "  'Throughout the ’70s and ’80s, Gerald Matthews lived next to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan in an apartment big enough to host rowdy parties. One drunken night he and a band of party-goers raided the museum grounds, and it was there and then they agreed on the need for a museum that presented a “less factual point of view.”After a successful acting career on Broadway and in commercials (he was the crooning voice of Sugar Bear for Sugar Crisp Cereal for 40 years), Matthews and his wife moved to Washington state in 1989. About a decade later, he found himself unsure what to do with the large constructions he’d made for this first solo show in Walla Walla. Then he found a spot above a drugstore on Main Street. He gutted and painted the place, installed his Surrealist and Absurdist sculptures and collages, and on September 10, 2001, opened the Museum of Un-Natural History.Some balk at the entryway—hence the “annoyed” in Matthews’ proposal for potential visitors: “Enter and be entertained or annoyed by Dada in Walla Walla.” But many visitors are indeed entertained and stick around to seecuriositieslike the “Velocipedus Rex” made of four bicycle rims and animal bones and the “Ingenious Mechanical Sperm Bank,” a mannequin with some interesting additions.Matthews continues to create new works in the large basement of his retirement home nearby, and every Saturday he can be found surveying the museum’s patrons admiring (or gawking at) whathe lovingly calls “opinionated, satiric iconoclastic creations of questionable taste.”',\n",

       "  'Ripe for quiet reflection and simply awe-inspiring, Canyons of the Ancients is an outdoor museum home to more than 6,000 archaeological sites, a concentration of historic treasures that’s unrivaled in the United States. This national monument is not widely publicized, but it has a lot to offer for anyone interested in Native American cultures.Spanning 176,000 acres, the landscape contains scores of well-preserved remnants of the area’s native cultures, such as the ruins of homes, reservoirs, shrines, farms, and entire villages. Most of the stone structures at the monument date from the era of the ancient Puebloans, who first built basic structures and eventually ended up with a village. It is estimated that they left the region sometime in the mid-1100s, moving to what is now Arizona and New Mexico. Exploring Canyons of the Ancients is a unique opportunity to observe, study, and experience how ancestral peoples lived and adapted over time in the American Southwest. Untouched by development, this remote and rugged landscape has preserved relics of humanity going back thousands of years. The sprawling grounds are also home to beautiful isolated canyons with incredible ruins—and usually not a lot of people. It can be difficult to reach some sites without enough time, but there are so many archeological valuables scattered all over this place, it would be virtually impossible to explore the entire area.
