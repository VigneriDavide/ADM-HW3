Architectural Antiques	['architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	440	246	It’s easy to get lost in this gorgeously cluttered warehouse, which is not necessarily a bad thing.A veritable labyrinth of architectural antiques, awaits exploration. From magnificent stained glass window panes to ornate salvaged woodwork such as doors, entryways, and mantles to glorious chandeliers that would make Marie Antoinette do a double take.Dig through dusty crates of antique fixtures and doo-dads galore or take a siesta in the darling outdoor courtyard where pretty wrought-iron cafe furniture and fanciful outdoor showpieces await.If you’re lucky, you may even stumble upon open art studios in the upper levels of the building, which are some of the most beautiful, stripped down warehouse studios in Northeast.	A warehouse for all of your architectural details. 	['Four Churches on One City Block', 'Geek Partnership Society', 'Thorp Building Navy Guard Towers']	1330 Quincy St NE Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55418 United States	45.0019	-93.2514	['lizzieboyle', 'profnewman']	2010-07-26 00:00:00		['The Japanese-Style\xa0House of Prospect Park South', 'Herz-Jesu-Kirche', 'Castillo Pittamiglio', 'Murtoa Stick Shed']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/architectural-antiques
