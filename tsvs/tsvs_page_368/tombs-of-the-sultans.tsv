Tombs of the Sultans 	['royalty', 'tombs', 'death']	439	970	Thanks to the Ottomans’ incredible sense of aesthetic, the tombs ofMehmed III, Selim II, Murad III, İbrahim I and Mustafa I more closely resemble stunning palaces in tribute to the memory of sultans past than what likelyleaps to mind when conjuring imagesof eternal resting places for ancient,deceasedroyals.The complex itself isarranged in a linear formation along the periphery of the Hagia Sophia. Often overlooked and quite literally overshadowed by what is possibly Istanbul’s most iconic sight, the tombs date from as early as 1574 and make extraordinary use of tilework, calligraphy, and paintwork. No two are alike, despitesharing common motifsarranged according to the preference of their designers, several of which were designed by thefamous architect MimarSinan.With doors flung open to the public, the sultans and their families retain their dignity and privacy by way ofshrouds of an impenetrable emerald green color draped over theirsarcophagi. Sloping at crispangles,standing bold against a field of fine ornate tiles, these eternal family portraits are uniquely striking.The closer one looks at the details, the more fascinating the sultans’ tombs become. Particularly true of this is the tomb of Sultan Selim II. On the architectural front, the fine blue tiles onthe door’s left side appear lighter in color duefor theoriginals wereremoved in1895; sent to France for restoration, they somehow ended up in the Louvre, where they remain to this day. The pale blue tiles on the tomb’s door are replacements that don’t quite match the originals on the opposing door.Similarly, though the sarcophagi themselves areintentionally anonymous under deceptively uniform shrouds, alook intothe backstory of each family reveals the humanity and drama hiddenbeneath. Selim II’s tomb is noticeablypacked with family members, manyof whom seem oddly small at the time of their deaths. Though not posted anywhere inside, history reveals that during the course ofone single night in 1574, five of his younger sons were murdered to ensure Murad III’s succession. But it doesn’t stop there… 19 of Murad’s own sons also can be found resting alongside him, murdered to ensurehis eldest’s succession, after which point the grisly practice of fratricide was put to an end.Imagine:this describes just one of the five tombs resting in the shadow of Hagia Sophia. The rest of the details – beautiful and chilling – await yourdeep dive into the individual lives of the sultans, their wives, each architect, and their designers. They’ll be there waiting, ever so patiently.	Five sultans and their families rest in eternal splendor, teeming with overlooked beauty and drama. 	['Viking Runes at Hagia Sophia', 'Hagia Sophia Wishing Column', 'Basilica Cisterns of Istanbul']	1 Kabasakal Cd.
