A Century of Hats	['hotels', 'collections', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	623	179	A Century of Hats is a genteel exhibit, in a genteel hotel lobby, in what is arguably America’s most genteel city.This 100-year-old parade of feathers, silk, and strawis housed in theMansion on Forsyth Park, Savannah’s premier luxuryhotel. The current 126-room hotel was built onto an existing 1888 mansion overlooking the historic district’s Forsyth Park. Its developer, Savannah-born Richard C. Kessler, is also an avid art collector and has filled the Mansion withover 400 pieces of original artwork, inspired by the history and romance of Savannah.The Century of Hats exhibit came about when Kessler made the acquaintance ofa Midwestern woman who dealt in vintage clothing. In passing, he mentioned his idea for an exhibit of historical ladies’ hats and before the conversation had ended, he had presented her with a $10,000 check to assemble his proposed collection. He only had to wait a short time before hat boxes beganappearingon his doorstep, containing every shape and flavor of headpiece everconceived.The hats inthe exhibit, whose provenancespans the 1860s-1960s, are arranged chronologically in two long display cases, flanked by two framed codices. Included in the collection is awedding bonnetfrom the 1860s,worn by aNorthern woman on the day of her marriage to a Southern gentleman. To the keensartorialeye, this fact will bedecipherableby the bonnet’s contrasting blue/white ribbon trim.A friendly waiter pointed out that when you stand in front of the display case, yourreflection allows youto “try on” the different specimens.	Tucked away inside a historic Savannah hotel is a hundred-year history presented in ladies' lids. 	['Johnny Mercer’s Childhood Home', 'Colonial Park Cemetery', 'The Marshall House']	700 Drayton Street Savannah, Georgia, 31401 United States	32.0673	-81.0946	['lady-delaney', 'collector-of-experiences']	2015-03-17 00:00:00		['Booze History Museum', 'Stazione Neapolis', 'African Heritage House ', 'Alaska Highway Hat Collection']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/a-century-of-hats
