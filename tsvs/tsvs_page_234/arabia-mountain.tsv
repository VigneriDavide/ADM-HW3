Arabia Mountain	['martian-landscapes', 'landscapes', 'mountains', 'ecosystems']	622	323	If you’re looking for a distinctly local experience inAtlanta, you’ll visit Arabia Mountain, located in the town of Lithonia outside the city.Arabia Mountain is Stone Mountain’s cooler, less crowded, and less controversial sibling (no massive confederate memorial etched into the side). There’s a lot of history behind this rock and its alien landscape, but just know that it’s well worth the drive—roughly 30 minutes from downtown Atlanta.	Like Mars, but much closer. 	['Cow Tower', 'Collectible and Antique Chair Gallery', 'Ferns of the World']	3350 Klondike Rd Lithonia, Georgia United States	33.6848	-84.1135	['mthurman52', 'mmwoodruff']	2019-05-07 00:00:00		['Qurnat As Sawda', 'Yangykala Canyon', 'Neptuni Åkrar', 'Wadi Rum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arabia-mountain
