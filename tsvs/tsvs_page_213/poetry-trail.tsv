Known for his use of colloquial speech to describe rural life and his unique, rhythmic approach to language, self-described as“the sound of sense,” Frostwrote and taught here for 23 years, amassing four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry over his lifetime.Many of Frost’s themes dealt with country life in New England, and his house property, a mix of forest and grassland,inspired many of thestories and existential thoughts he wrote of. Hence, due to itshistorical significance, an overwhelming amount of local Frost aficionados lobbiedthe government of Franconiato purchasethe former Frost property and restoreitfrom a private residence to a museum. And once the city did so in 1976, theybegan to Frost-ifying the surrounding lands.One thing the town did to show the inspiration Frost drew from nature was create a quarter-mile nature trail meandering through the surrounding woods and prairies, with a handful of plaques along the way featuring Frost’s poetry. This “Poetry Trail” is only known to a small community ofpoetry buffs around the world, but those aspiring young poets who travel hereas a poetic pilgrimage draw tremendous inspiration from the brilliant mind of Frost.Many of Frost’s works displayed on the plaques describenature. Some deal withexistential questions, such as in one of Frost’s greatestpoems, “Fire and Ice”:Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I’ve tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice.The short visit and stroll through the Poetry Trail at “The Frost Place” brings to all visitors, young and old, the love of poetry—something we all could certainly use more of in our lives.	A short nature trail winds through the greatest works of poet Robert Frost. 	['New England Ski Museum', 'Old Man of the Mountain Profiler Plaza', 'Betty and Barney Hill Memorials']	158 Ridge Rd Franconia, New Hampshire United States	44.2121	-71.7572	['moviesbylew', 'proberts']	2016-08-01 00:00:00		"['Walt Disney Hometown Museum', 'David Roche House Museum', ""Bishops' House"", 'Thomas Wolfe Memorial']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poetry-trail
