An elevator takes guests up through the inside of the tank for a full 360-degree view of the fish as well as the divers whocare for them and the tank on a daily basis.The AquaDom was built by the Union Investment Real Estate GmbH at a cost of 13 million euros for the aquarium alone. Biological management lies with the Berlin Society for Large Aquariums.The AquaDom is maintained by Sea Life Berlin, which is located right next to the hotel. Visitors to both the hotel and Sea Life Berlin can take a breathtaking ride in this one-of-a-kind sea life habitat.	The largest free standing aquarium in the world resides in a hotel lobby in Berlin. 	['The DDR Museum', 'Marx and Engels Forum', 'Hohenzollern Crypt in the Berlin Cathedral']	Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 3 Berlin, 10178 Germany	52.5194	13.4029	['burt', 'reley250']	2012-03-04 00:00:00		['Montaña Mágica Lodge', 'Dog Bark Park Inn', 'Camino Real Sumiya', 'Hotel del Coronado']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aquadom-at-radisson-blu-berlin
