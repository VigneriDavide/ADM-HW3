Builtupon a foundation of handmade, heirloom-quality wooden toys, the family-owned business has expanded to include not only an envy-inducing selection of toys for kids and adults alike, but also an 18-hole mini-golf course and a candy shop.Flash and dazzle aside,toy connoisseurs understand that the true magic of Lark lies in its proud history. Scattered throughout its lauded store are aseries ofantique displays positioned throughout the building known as “Memory Lane.”Thousands of toys from eras past are tucked within a series of glass cases, showcasing the favored toys ofour forefathers. Howdy Doody hangs out alongside little green army men, Barbie keeps company with the elegant dolls and nesting dolls that came long before, while separate nooks pay homage to tin doll houses and Erector sets, and yet another area contains an original bicycle surrey, pedal cars, and much more. To keep the spirit and continuity going, Lark gratefully accepts donations of toys for itsever expanding historicalcollection.All that said, Lark’s starattraction is itshandmade, full-sized carousel housed within the store. Donn Kreofsky, the store’s former owner, worked with a carver named Bill Stark to create the carousel, which is made from Minnesota basswood. The “rideable work of art,” as it’s known, has been running since 1997.Rather than sticking to the horses of more traditional carousels, no twoseats at the Lark carousel are alike, and there is only one horse. Rather, each seat takes the form of an animalcarved in exquisite detail; adragon and amajestic stag race a grinning boar, whileaplayful river otter keeps company within arms’ reach of an albino buffalo and a madly dashing wolf, even as countless other characters on the carousel turn just out of sight.It’s as if the creator understood the power inherent intaking a turn on hiscreation,populated by a world offantastic, peacefully coexisting animals, or wandering the halls of a toy store where not so much has changed across generations; in enjoying thatbrief respite from reality, visitors to Larkseem to beable toturn back the wheel ever so slightlybefore reenteringthe world outside its doors, perhaps just a hair more in-touch withtheyouthful innocencethat can beso easy to lose along the way.	This secret gem of a toy store houses a rideable carousel populated with fantasy animals. 	"['Suncrest Gardens Pizza Farm', ""Doug Padilla's Art Studio"", 'Prairie Moon']"	63604 170th Avenue Kellogg, Minnesota, 55945 United States	44.3017	-92.0038	['dlukenelson', 'collector-of-experiences']	2015-08-06 00:00:00		"[""World's Largest Working Wooden Yo-Yo"", 'Don Sshinda Collection', 'House of Marbles', 'Rubber Chicken Museum']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lark-toys
