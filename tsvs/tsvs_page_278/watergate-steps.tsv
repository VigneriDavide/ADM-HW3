Watergate Steps	['public-works', 'stairs', 'rivers', 'politics']	552	1103	Few people know that the first Watergate wasn’t the hotel where a presidential scandal took place. It was a forgotten staircase on Washington, D.C.’s waterfront.The stairs were originally intended to act as a dock for visiting dignitaries and politicians disembarking off the Potomac River. The ideawas that guests would ascend the 40 concrete steps of the grand staircase from the river tothe Lincoln Memorial as they entered the United Statescapital.This plan didn’t pan out, and instead, the Watergate Stepsbecame a concert space. The orchestra would play on a barge docked in the Potomac while the audiencesat on the steps beneath the night sky. The “Sunset Symphonies” went on from 1935 until 1965, when they were canceled because the noise from jets flying overhead drowned out the music.The original Watergate steps remain, a useless set of stairs leading to nowhere that are still an integral part of the National Mall’slandscape.	"Decades before the scandal, this staircase on the river was a literal ""water gate."" "	['Lincoln Memorial Undercroft', 'Abandoned Drawbridge Control Room', 'The K-9 of the Korean War Veterans Memorial']	620 Ohio Drive Southwest Washington, District of Columbia United States	38.8893	-77.0526	['molly-mcbride-jacobson', 'kristin1108']	2016-11-29 00:00:00	['6 Places to the Relive the Watergate Scandal']	['Parker Dam', 'Yamuna Ghat', 'Site of Execution Dock', 'The Glendale Steps']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/watergate-steps
