Dolní Morava Sky Walk	['playgrounds', 'resorts', 'mountains']	551	41	Scenic walkways have leveled up as of December 2015, when Czech architecture firm Fránek Architects debuted their extreme Sky Walk on a peakin the Králický Sněžník Mountains.High atop one of Dolní Morava’s famed peaks sitsa looping structurethat looks more like a space-age roller coaster than ascenic walkway. Offering panoramic views of the Morava river valley and the rest of the surrounding mountain range, the year-round adventure resort set out to add a little something extra to the experience of stickingone’s head in the clouds.Accessible by chairlift from the resort’sMarcelka chalet, visitors ascend to a total of 3,600 feet above sea level to the top of Mount Králický Sněžník, where Sky Walk awaits. Despite its daunting appearance and precarious location, the Sky Walk’s wooden tierswere specificallydesigned to be easy to climb; thanks to its stair-less construction, Sky Walk is equally accessible to those visitors on foot as folkspushing strollers or in wheelchairs.After taking in all the nature one can handle at the peak of its 180-foot viewpoint, the best parts of Sky Walk still awaitexploration. Really big, brave kids and adults alike have a coupledaredevil options at their disposal. Rather than boasting one of those trendy glass-bottom platformsthat seem prone to breaking, Sky Walk went witha mesh web strung insideits highest loop, where the bold canactually lay among the clouds and mountain air. For those who prefer the feeling of brisk movement over floating, designers included a 328-foot polished metalslide (technically a helter-skelter) through the heart of thebeast.If hovering in mid-air or dropping a total of 18 stories isn’t your idea of a good time, fear not – taking the traditional route down Sky Walk’s smooth plane is a viableoption… though if you’re honest with yourself, you’ll likely spend the rest of your life thinking about your missed connection with that slide.The full impact of Sky Walkends up being akin to aChoose-Your-Own-Adventure nature experience, where visitors can dial back the thrill level to suit their individual preference. We’re excited to see whatwalkway designers come up with next to topthat.	The world's greatest slide descends 18 stories from this looping mountaintop viewing platform. 	['Velké Losiny Château', 'Josef Vachal Museum', 'Błędne Skały']	Velká Morava 46 Dolní Morava Czechia	50.1255	16.8004	['littlebrumble', 'blindcolour']	2016-01-29 00:00:00		['Abandoned Chacaltaya Ski Resort', 'Llechwedd Caverns Trampoline Park', 'Wild Horses of Shannon County ', 'Falls Creek Falls']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sky-walk
