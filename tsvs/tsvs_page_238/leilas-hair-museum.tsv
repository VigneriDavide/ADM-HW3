Though turning hair into wreaths was something of a Victorian obsession, hair art actually dates back to at least the 1400s.Some of the displays in Cohoon’s collection come from as far back as the 17th century. In an age before photography, collecting hair was a way of capturing the essence of a person at a point in time, and keeping the memory of a deceased love one near. “That is the only part of that human body that’s still here,” says Cohoon.	A museum celebrating the Victorian obsession with hair art. 	['The Bingham-Waggoner Estate', 'Independence Temple', 'Vaile Mansion']	1333 South Noland Road Independence, Missouri, 64055 United States	39.076	-94.4138	['josh', 'henry']	2008-12-04 00:00:00	['The Ultimate Guide to Scattered Body Parts']	"['Hair Jewelry Exhibit at the Bangsbo Museum', 'Deke Slayton Memorial Space & Bicycle Museum', ""Bestattungsmuseum (Vienna Undertakers' Museum)"", 'Rasputin Museum at Yusupov Palace']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leilas-hair-museum
