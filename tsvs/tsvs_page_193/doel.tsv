The Doomed City of Doel	['ghost-towns', 'architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	707	311	In the very near future, Doel, Belgium will only exist in pictures and memories. The tiny village is scheduled to be completely destroyed to make room for an expanding harbor, and even protest and the incredible street art in the abandoned town cannot stop the inevitable destruction.For 700 years, Doel stood near Antwerp along the Scheldt River in Belgium, and includes a home that once belonged to the family of painter Peter Paul Reubens. As Antwerp expanded in the 20th century, its port needed more space, and Doel quickly became a target for demolition. Trying to force residents out, the government scheduled demolitions multiple times, but were beaten by popular protests from the 1970s through the 1990s.But despite the will of the people, Doel could not be saved and in 1999, the town was officially scheduled for complete demolition. In2007,a campaign group called Doel 2020set into motion a planto ensure Doel’ssurvival by turning it into a haven for street artists. Since that time, residents have trickled outasartists have made their way in.The increasingly abandonedtown became the perfect playground forstreet artists from across Europe to debut their works around Doel.Today, there are only about25inhabitants left of the original 1,300, all of whom are bravely flauntingmandates that they vacate their homes immediately. Meanwhile the town has been transformed into a post-apocalyptic artistic paradisethanks to themurals covering each and every building.Despite these people’s stubborn refusal to leave, the government plans to continue with demolition, at which point all traces of Doel, fromresidents’ homes to thethe living street art, will be lost forever.You can see some lovely drone shots of Doel in this video.	This ghost town in Belgium will lose its street art when it ceases to exist. 	"['Hof ter Saksen', ""St. Anna's Tunnel"", 'The Whisperer']"	Beveren, 9130 Belgium	51.3116	4.2629	['facebook751440664', 'vrielinkie']	2011-12-02 00:00:00		"['Burke Ghost Town', 'Fordlândia', 'Uplistsikhe Cave Town', ""Hiroshima's Hypocenter""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/doel
