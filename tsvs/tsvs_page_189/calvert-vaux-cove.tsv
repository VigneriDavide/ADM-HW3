Calvert Vaux Cove	['trash', 'boats', 'beaches', 'hidden', 'abandoned']	718	126	There are hidden gems throughoutNew York City, and this is no exception. A derelict boat wades gently in the cove of the Gravesend Bay, retired from its former life as a mode of transportation. The rusted, overturned vessel floats among rubbish while trees hang overheadand graffiti lay still as a backdrop.The bay is on the edge of Calvert Vaux Park and a car junkyard. A small path leads the curious adventurer down a slope, through tall brush that reveals the hidden beach. You’d assume fine grain sand would cover the landscape and bleed into the water, but this is not the case. Quite the opposite, this site features large, slippery rocks, red bricks, big chunks of asphalt from unknown streets, and trash, as if it were Brooklyn’s personal disposal bin.	This small, hidden cove is home to abandoned boats. 	['Coney Island Creek', 'Coney Island Mermaid Parade', 'Childs Restaurant Building']	4302 Westshore Ave Brooklyn, New York, 11214 United States	40.5853	-73.998	['climbrick', 'anna-minster']	2019-05-17 00:00:00		['The Scarista Bus', 'Harbor Island Abandoned Houses', 'Perla 2 ', 'TEPCO Beach']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calvert-vaux-cove
