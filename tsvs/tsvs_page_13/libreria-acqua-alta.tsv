Libreria Acqua Alta	['bookstores', 'shops']	2575	1183	Keeping a collection of books in a city where the roads are made of water is a dangerous idea to begin with, but Venice’sLibreria Acqua Alta has nothing to fear since they just keep all their titles in waterproof basins.The self-proclaimed “most beautiful bookstore in the world” is composed of a number of over-stuffed rooms stacked wall-to-wall with books, magazines, maps, and other ephemera. Due to Venice’s constant flooding, however, these picturesque piles are all placed inside bathtubs, waterproof bins, and in one room a full-size gondola.The name itself even means “Book Store of High Water.” When the local waterways rise to fill the store, the water can rise inches off the floor, which would destroy any other collection. The store’s whimsically cramped atmosphere is even reflected in their “fire escape,” which is simply a door leading directly out into a canal. To really complete the look, the store has become home to more than one stray cat, who are also able to escape the rising tides by hanging out atop the stacks.	This Venice bookstore has resigned itself to constant flooding by keeping its books in bathtubs and boats. 	"['Scuola Grande di San Marco', 'The Flooded Crypt of San Zaccaria', ""Reliquaries of St Mark's Basilica Treasury""]"	5173 Calle Lunga 5176/B Venice Italy	45.438	12.3423	['zackofalltrades', 'ce65fd95-c9f9-4b8d-84f8-bb0d7635401c']	2013-02-13 00:00:00		['White Rabbit Books & Curiosities', 'Booked Up', 'Le Roy Lire', 'Faulkner House Books']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/libreria-acqua-alta
