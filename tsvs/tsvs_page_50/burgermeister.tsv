Burgermeister	['bathrooms', 'trains', 'food']	1457	805	One of the most delightful aspectsof traveling the world issampling the local street food. Taco carts, hot dog stands, creperies… what better way to immerse yourself into the local culture? In the case of Berlin, Germany, at least one way to do that exists while also sounding incredibly brave (or foolish, depending) when recounting the adventures to friends and family upon returning home again.Enter:Burgermeister. The snack shack, whose name is aclever play on the German word for “mayor,” may seem to slingburgers and fries like any other joint of its ilk, but the details of Burgermeister are where the place really distinguishes itselffrom the pack. Located directly underthe U-Bahn tracks, its utilitarian shape and dull green paint and “Männer” sign at the restaurant’s far endreveal the space’sformer life as a public toilet building.Yes, you read that right. The reigning late-night, counter service burger joint of choice in Berlin is located insidean old train loo, scrubbed of all its goo. Customers take a ticket, deli-style, from a counter and wait patiently (or drunkenly, depending on the day and hour) for abusy worker, seen running hither and dither throughout the standing-room-only restaurant, to deliver their American-style treat.Burgermeister’s food has been praised by several critics, making it worthy of the bonusbraggadocio you’ll add when regaling yourmates ofthattime you ate a hamburger in a restaurant that used to be a bathroom, and lived to tell the tale.The beautiful Oberbaumbrücke nearby offers a great view of the Berlin skyline and the river Spree, get your grub to go and eat by the water for a quintessential Berlin experience.	Where once there was a train station bathroom, there is now this German burger joint.  	['Vestiges of the Berlin Wall', 'Oberhafenkantine Berlin', 'Badeschiff']	10 Oberbaumstraße Berlin, 10997 Germany	52.5011	13.4423	['hayleyknoph']	2016-04-13 00:00:00		"['Fish Car No. 3', ""Easey's"", ""Jungle Jim's International Market"", 'Maeklong Railway Market']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burgermeister
