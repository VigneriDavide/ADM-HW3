Ziggy Stardust Plaque	['plaques', 'music']	1042	304	Rock and roll might be an auditory art form, but some images mean just as much to the history of the genre as any song. Such is the iconic image of David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust emerging into the night on the cover of his titular album. The moment is so iconic that there is even a plaque on the spot commemorating it.On the cover of his 1972 album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,David Bowieemerges as his rock alter ego, Ziggy Stardust. He stares pensively, soulfully back at the camera, elbow resting on a raised knee, guitar strung loosely over his shoulder. Facing photographerBrian Ward, the musicianstands in the January shadows of a small side-street in London, off Regent Street.The famous image was captured in black and white and hand-colored by artist Terry Pastor.That very spot, atNumber 23, Heddon Street, is now marked with a commemorative plaque. Ablack circle with white type, it states: “Ziggy Stardust 1972,” with smaller type stretching along the border that says, “This marks the location of the cover photograph for the iconic David Bowie album “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.” The plaque was installed on March 28, 2012 and unveiled bySpandau Ballet guitarist and Bowie superfan Gary Kemp. It is unlike blue and green plaques commemorating famous landmarks and people installed by English Heritage or Westminster Council; “Ziggy Stardust 1972” is in fact one of just a small handful of plaques extended to fictional characters (you can find ones for Sherlock Holmes and Lara Croft elsewhere in London).Heddon Street is very different from when Ziggy Stardust first stepped foot there to ring in Bowie’s fifth studio album. It now hasbrighter storefronts, morestores and cafes, and now a new plaque, too.	This London plaque marks the spot where David Bowie's famous alien made his debut. 	['Huntsman & Sons', 'Allies Sculpture', 'K2 Telephone Boxes ']	Number 23, Heddon Street London, England, W1B 4BQ United Kingdom	51.5111	-0.1399	['taotaoholmes', 'julius-spada']	2016-01-04 00:00:00		"[""Site of Alice's Restaurant "", '15 London Street ', 'Kurt Cobain Memorial Park', 'Pink Floyd Plaque']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ziggy-stardust-plaque
