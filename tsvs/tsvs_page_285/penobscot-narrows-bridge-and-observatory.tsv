Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory	['observatories', 'bridges']	542	617	While there are innumerable bridges and observation towers scattered around the planet, it’s considerablymore rare to witnessthe combination of these two lovely structures.There are only a handful ofbridge observatories in the world, and this 2,120-foot-long cable suspension bridge over the Penobscot River (aka “the Narrows”) between Verona Island and Prospect, Maine is home to one of the them.The Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory has the distinction of being thefirst bridge observation tower in the U.S. as well as the tallest public bridge observatory in the world.The bridge itself is a beautiful sight and worth astop while driving along Route 1 in itself, and the 420-foot-high observation tower makes it all the better. Taking the elevator up 42 stories to the observation roomyou’re met with beautiful 360-degree views of the river and bay below, the nearby village of Bucksport, and the historic Fort Knox, which, built in 1844, is one of the best preserved fortifications on the New England seacoast. Some say it’s the best view in Maine.	The first bridge observation tower in the U.S. offers one of the best views of Maine. 	['Fort Knox State Historic Site', 'Northeast Historic Film', 'Grave of Sarah Ware']	U.S. 1 Verona Island, Maine United States	44.5598	-68.8015	['solarconstant', 'quickie55']	2016-08-26 00:00:00		"['Museum of the Old Bridge', 'Las Coloradas Bridge', 'The Ghost Bridge of Oak Ridge Reservoir', ""Stone's Bridge""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penobscot-narrows-bridge-and-observatory
