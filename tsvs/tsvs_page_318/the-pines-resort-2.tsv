The Pines Resort	['hotels', 'abandoned']	499	146	The Pines Resort was constructed in 1933 in the Catskill region of New York complete with 400 rooms, an ice skating rink, indoor and outdoor pools, a theater, nightclub, poker rooms, and more. The entire resort covered some 96-acres.Despite these lavish offerings, the resort was forced to close in 1998 due to financial problems. Now it stands abandoned, with many of the ceilings collapsing due to immense water damage. Despite the rash of damages, most of the buildings are still standing. There have been rumors of active demolitions taking place across the site since 2011, however, this is not active year-round. Update as of March 2020: The campus is under nearby construction. Most buildings remain, however, none are accessible due to collapsed roofs.	This once sprawling resort now sits abandoned, filled with graffiti and vibrant colors from an era long passed.  	['Neversink', 'White Lake Mansion House Ruins', 'Parksville']	167 Laurel Ave Fallsburg, New York, 12733 United States	41.7221	-74.6246	['thekopasclan', 'angiebaby4077']	2019-11-20 00:00:00		"['Abandoned Hotel Evropa', 'Cape Eleuthera Resort Ruins', ""Witch's Hat Pavilion"", 'Abandoned Hotel at Cala d’en Serra']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pines-resort-2
