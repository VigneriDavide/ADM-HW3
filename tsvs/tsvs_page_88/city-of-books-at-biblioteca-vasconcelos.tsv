Biblioteca Vasconcelos	['repositories-of-knowledge', 'libraries', 'books', 'collections', 'architecture']	1111	280	The world is teeming with stunning libraries, butprecious few manage to seamlessly cater to design, the people, and history in such an admirable manner as Mexico City’s Biblioteca Vasconcelos.Located in the Buenavista areain the north of Mexico City, the massive Biblioteca Vasconcelos was designed by Alberto Kalach and completed in 2007 after three consecutive years of building. Situated among lush gardens and covering an area of over 38,000 square meters, this temple of knowledge is generally referred to as a “megalibrary” both for its size and the undeniable sense ofimport conveyed bythe structure itself.Transparentwalls, stories of intentionally slightly mismatched floors, and intricate networks of balconies and paths between replicating stacks let visitors literally get lost in the worlds contained within the books themselves.This library resembles something from a short story by the Argentinian magical realist author Jorge Luis Borges.It seems like it would be easy to lose yourself in the Biblioteca Vasconcelos. Because just like the non-textualworld, in a megalibrary the options are endless. Choose wisely.	"A jaw-dropping ""megalibrary"" that turns book-browsing into a geometric adventure. "	['Museo de Geología (Museum of the Institute of Geology)', 'Museo Universitario del Chopo (Chopo University Museum)', 'Torre Insignia Carillon']	187 Aldama Mexico City, 06350 Mexico	19.4468	-99.1519	['sergioski02', 'mario-yair-ts']	2015-06-12 00:00:00		['The Matenadaran', 'Baroque Library of Metten Abbey', 'Bibliotheca Thysiana', 'Castle of Light']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-of-books-at-biblioteca-vasconcelos
