Man in the Sea Museum	['exploration', 'oceans', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	446	159	Among the most complete – and oddly nonchalant – assemblages of its kind in the world, the Man in the Sea Museum has an almost absurdist air to the frankness with which it portrays man’s attempts toexplore the bizarre worlds at the heart of our oceans.Founded in 1982 by the Institute of Diving, a collective of divers from the U.S. Navy’s SEALAB Program, the Man in the Sea Museum charmingly follows the history of mankind’s attempts at deep sea exploration. from early diving bells and diving suit rigs dating back to 1837, to bathyspheres prototypes for modern day manned mini-submarines and remotely piloted exploratorycraft. As a bonus, treasures recovered from 16th-century sunken galleons off the Florida coast are peppered throughout the museum’s 5,000-square-foot interior.The true magnificence of the Man in the Sea Museum, however, is born of the cumulativeeffectof laying these craft out in a linear, straightforward displaypaired with the ability to examine them up-close. Such examination quickly reveals just how brave (or insane)the earliestcaptains must have been to undertake these ventures.Strangelyenough, thepart of themuseum best illustrating this is actually the parking lot, which is rimmed with the collection’s biggest features.Streamlined like a spaceship pointed in the wrong direction and painted a Pepto Bismol-pink, SEALAB-1 is Man in the Sea’s crown jewel. First launched in 1964, the world’s first working undersea habitat is kept withports open for the curious of all ages to scramble through, marveling at the idea of being stuck inside such cramped quarters without escape.Next in chronological order comes the Deep Dive System Mark 1, an experimental prototypedispatched in 1968.A quick glance from SEALAB-1 to the white contraption aheadreveals what a difference four years of the 1960s psychedelics crazy had on the Navy’s engineers. Seemingly constructed fromwhat appears to be an assortment of elbow joints leftover from your great-uncle’s failed plumbing project, hoping a whitepaint job wouldpresenta modaesthetic.We’d be remiss if we didn’t point out thatsome of the displays (both inside and out) are not the most spit-polished in appearance. But, aside from adding to its homespun charm, that’s ratherfitting for a museum celebratingthis specific typeof exploration that has never not-involved a healthy dose of both finger crossing and duct tape – figuratively, and it would appear, literally.	A graveyard of bathyspheres and diving bells paints a weirdly accurate account of ocean exploration's rickety history. 	['Moss Hill Methodist Church Handprints', 'Vernon, Florida', 'Seacrest Wolf Preserve']	17314 Panama City Beach Parkway Panama City Beach, Florida, 32413 United States	30.2325	-85.8931	['amissile', 'littlebrumble']	2015-10-29 00:00:00	['The Wonders of Florida in 24 Museums']	['Museo Robert Brady ', 'Powell-Cotton Ethnographic Collection', 'Nao Victoria Museum', 'Powell-Cotton Dioramas']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/man-in-the-sea-museum
