I will learn to write, to print and to decorate,”wrote Thomas JamesCobden-Sanderson of his life’s mission as bookbinder and font designer. Little did he know thelegacy he was destined to leave, and that the only thing left standing would be a pub.WhenCobden-Sanderson established his first bindery in 1893 inLondon’s Hammersmith neighborhood, it made perfect sense that he would tip his hat to the local haunt of literary giants sitting just around the corner: The Dove public house.Founded in the early- to mid-18th century, the tavern had already housed a generous cross-section of writers and creativesby the time Cobden-Sanderson paid his tribute.Poet James Thomson is said to have composed his “Rule Britannia” underits eaves in 1740, andA.P. Herbert went on to immortalize the pub itself within his pages under the guise of “The Pigeon” in 1930.Though the pub was addedto England’s National Heritage List in June of 1954, the Dove has operated with few changes for centuries. To this day, the Dove’s doors remain open to one and all.Meanwhile, Coburn-Sanderson’sinextricably linked DoveBindery couldn’thave taken a more opposing tack from the pub after which it was named. In 1901the bookbinderexpanded his business in the form of a joint venture with Emery Walker. Together they openedDoves Press, located just around the corner from the Dove tavern.The venture provedhugely successful; their five volume “English Bible” made the press a large profit. These “Doves Bibles” are still immensely valuable and can fetchover$45,000when soldtoday.Over time, however, the two men’s personal and professional relationship broke down. They finally severed theirpartnership in 1909, agreeing that Walker would have ownership of the businessafter Cobden-Sanderson’s death.Increasingly erratic, Cobden-Sanderson declaredthat Walker would never have access to the press’ renowned typeface and began clandestinely “bequeathing” Doves Typeto the River Thames. By 1916 he had slowly but surely thrown more than a ton (or 2,600 pounds) of the typeface,bundled into individual 12-pound paper parcels off the side of the nearby Hammersmith Bridge.Out of vindictivenessto his former partner, theworld had also been forced to give upDoves Type for lost, for if Cobden-Sanderson couldn’t use it, he determined no one else would either.Or so the story went until November 2014, when 150 pieces of the original typeface weresalvaged from the Thames by a very determined designer named Robert Green. Adigital facsimile of the font is now available, which can be best perusedwhile sipping on a pint atthe Dove, gazing towardthe Hammersmith Bridge, and chuckling about the immortal—almost spiteful—nature of all truly great work.	A glorious pub known for a spiteful printing feud and its famous typeface lost—then found—at the bottom of the Thames. 	"[""Leg o' Mutton Reservoir and Park"", 'WWT London Wetland Centre', '36 Blythe Road']"	19 Upper Mall London, England, W6 9TA United Kingdom	51.4905	-0.2348	['paulypaul', 'seanetta']	2016-08-08 00:00:00		"['Denver Zine Library', ""REI's Wall of Litho Stones"", 'The Reichenbach Falls', 'Lu Xun Memorial Park']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dove-london-england
