Mole Hill	['volcanoes', 'geology']	783	165	Mole Hill is one of the youngest volcanoes in the Eastern United States, and is probably the last active volcano on the Eastern seaboard. It was last active 47 million years ago. It is one of two volcanoes in the Commonwealth of Virginia. (Tthe other is Trimble Knob in Monterey, Virginia.)Classifying a volcano as dormant or extinct is a subjective and inexact exercise. Mole Hillis most likely extinct but could be considered long dormant.Whether or not inactive volcanoes are considered truly extinct, or just dormant, depends partly on the average repose interval between eruptions. As noted ineruptive variability, explosive eruptions like those atTobaand Yellowstone have repose intervals of hundreds of thousands of years, whereas non-explosive eruptions have very short repose intervals. Thus, theYellowstoneregion, which has not experienced an eruption for 70,000 years, can not be considered extinct. In fact, many scientists consider Yellowstone to be active because of high uplift rates, frequent earthquakes, and a very active geothermal system. Many inactive scoria cones, on the other hand, may be viewed as extinct shortly after they erupt, because such volcanoes are typically monogenetic and only erupt once.	One of the last active volcanoes on the Eastern seaboard. 	"[""American Shakespeare Center's Blackfriars Playhouse"", 'Camera Heritage Museum', 'Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Markers']"	Valley Vista Dr Dayton, Virginia United States	38.4482	-78.9528	['sdowell3', 'charlottejrf']	2016-07-22 00:00:00		['Basalt Plug', 'Valley of 10,000 Smokes', 'Formica Léo', 'Volcán de Tajogaite']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mole-hill
