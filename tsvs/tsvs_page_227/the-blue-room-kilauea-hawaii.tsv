The Blue Room	['glowing', 'grottoes', 'caves', 'ecosystems', 'water']	635	130	The last of three caves on a short hike up from the roadand down a steep rocky scramble, Waikapalae wet cave on the island of Kauai is also known as the Blue Room for its secret back grotto, which glowed an otherworldly blue. The blue of the grotto has been explained as sunlight reflecting off calcite, though some people attribute the blue to a more…out of this world explanation. The cave system in which it is located is associated with a Hawaiian mo’o goddess, a shapeshifting spirit of the deep.Unfortunately the effect has diminished as the cave’s water levels have dropped. Its unusual blueness isapparently still visible when the tideis highestand the sun is just north of Ha’ena State Park.Although swimming inWaikapalae is officially discouraged, the unofficial understandingseems to be “do it briefly at your own peril, but not with open wounds, and don’t drink the water.” (As with othertropical freshwater pools, there’s risk ofleptospirosis.) Afterward, it’s a briefwalkto the fully legal swimming at Ke’e Beach.The Blue Roomalso made a cameo as the fountain of youth in 2011’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides andis also a sort of unofficial sister-cave to Italy’s famousBlue Grotto.
