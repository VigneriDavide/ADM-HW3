The Wahweap Hoodoos	['rock-formations', 'rocks', 'geological-oddities', 'geology']	1366	268	In the dry lands of Southern Utah, three hours north of the Grand Canyon’s South Rim,lies a rarely used 9.2 mile out-and-back trail. The trail usage may be low, but those who take the 5 hour hike will be rewarded with one of the strangest geologicalsights on the continent.Youbeginat the confluence of Coyote Creek, Wahweap Creek, and thepeculiarly-named Nipple Creek,where you willhike under directsunlight on the Wahweap Wash. At the 0.5 Mile Mark you will reach the dilapidated “Hanging Fence”, and finally, by the 3.6 Mile Mark, you will have entered the first of the Wahweap Hoodoos.These unusual rock formations began formingover 100 million years ago when T-Rex’s roamed Utah. A “hoodoo” is a column of weathered rock, formed when a thick layer of soft rock is covered by a thin layer of hard rock. Sometimes, whencracks in thehard rock allow the underlying soft rock to erode, onesmall cap of the hard rock is resistant to cracking, and it protects the underlying soft rock.This cone of protected rock eventuallytakes the shape ofa vertical pinnacle.This is exactly the case for the Wahweap Hoodoos. These white sandstone spires, which have been namedeverything from“goblins” to “white ghosts,” look like they came straight out of the mind of Dr. Seuss.	"Giant pinnacles in the sun-scorched lands of Southern Utah have been nicknamed ""white ghosts."" "	"['Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument ', 'The Wave', ""Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell""]"	Wahweap Hoodoos Kanab, Utah, 84741 United States	37.1601	-111.7106	['moviesbylew', 'agmpietrow']	2016-05-04 00:00:00		['Indian Head', 'Teakettle Rock', 'Panská Skála', 'Halldórsskora (Elephant Rock)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wahweap-hoodoos
