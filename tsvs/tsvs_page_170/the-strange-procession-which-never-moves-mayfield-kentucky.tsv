The Strange Procession Which Never Moves	['death', 'cemeteries', 'monuments']	771	131	Mayfield, Kentucky’s cemetery contains a strangelysinistervision. Eighteenmonuments – mostly human, although there is also a horse, twodogs, onedeer, and a fox –gazeinto the East, staring out across a field of nothing but the dead.Commissioned byColonel Henry G. Wooldridge and built over the courseof seven years until Wooldridge’s own death on May 30, 1899, the monumentcommemorates family members and other loved ones Wooldridge lost over the course of his lifetime. After more than a century of visitation by a public fascinated by the spectacle, the site has acquired an unofficial, completelydisconcerting name: “The Strange Procession Which Never Moves.”Prompted by no one but his own aching heart, the man spent his last years pouring his fortune into immortalizing all that was irretrievably lost in stunning fashion. Unfortunately, this gesture was just as fundamentally lost on its earliest viewers, who mistook his monument as a literal money pit worthy ofattempted plundering,rather than appreciating it for the gorgeously metaphoric treasure chestit simply is.Populated with likenesses of those from Woolridge’s past, including a childhood sweetheart or his great-niece (depending on the lore), all of his sisters, his horse named “Fop,”plushis mother, brothers, as well asother creatures great and small who had beenclose to his heart. And while it may look like a small, very creepy private cemetery within the larger Maplewood Cemetery, Wooldridge is the only person actually entombed within the cordoned-offsite.	Everyone and everything one man ever loved and lost, now stare into the East for all eternity. 	['Apple Valley Hillbilly Garden and Toyland', 'Floodwall Murals', 'The Super Museum']	611 North 5th Street Mayfield, Kentucky, 42066 United States	36.7476	-88.6332	['davall', 'kenj']	2016-10-31 00:00:00		['Mount Pleasant Cemetery', 'Brooklyn Theatre Fire Memorial', 'Massacre of Glencoe Monument', 'Burke and Wills Monument']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-strange-procession-which-never-moves-mayfield-kentucky
