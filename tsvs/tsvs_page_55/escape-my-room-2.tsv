Escape My Room	['wunderkammers', 'games', 'mystery']	1394	156	In a city populated with eccentric characters, New Orleans’riddle-loving DeLaporte family may take the king cake. According to legend, their infamouslycurious, sprawling mansion was demolished to make way for a new hospital complex near the New Orleans Superdome. Relics of their former glory disappeared (only to mysteriously reappear) in the guise of several, puzzling rooms insidea former perfume shop.Visitors are advised to keep theirwits about them,whence they may find theDeLaporte treasure, lost for years.…Or so the story goes. Did the DeLaporte family ever exist? The cacheof mysterious treasures – known and waiting to be discovered – could behewn fromnothing more than Spanishmoss and New Orleans’ thick air.What remainsunquestionably trueis that only those who are especially clever manage to escape unaided; statistically speaking, justone in three succeed insolving the rotating cadre of riddles unaided.The rest of the game’s participants join the ranks of thoselost investigators leftwandering the room for all eternity… or, rather, until the hour has expiredand the appointed guide reveals all thedevilishly difficult clues they’d missed along the way.A visit to “the DeLaporte family ruins” includes choosing to experience the Jazz Parlor or the Mardi Gras Study, whence participants aregiven only one singlehour to figure out the mystery. If successful, this reveals a specific aspect of thefamily’s “long and storied history,” thereby elucidating something occult and glorious about present-day New Orleans that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. That last bit is the true treasure at stake.The carnivalesquewaiting room is a wunderkammer in and of itself worth a visit, regardless of the items’ authenticity. Populated with bizarre taxidermy creations, antique furniture, and reanimated creatures that look straight out of Brazil, Escape My Room is the kind ofuniquely entertaining exploration of the intersection between fact, legend, spook, and intellect that fitsNew Orleans to a T.	Imagine playing a version of Legends of the Hidden Temple, but with a distinctly Southern Gothic flare. 	['United Fruit Company Building', 'National World War II Museum', 'Louisiana’s Civil War Museum at Confederate Memorial Hall']	633 Constance St New Orleans, Louisiana, 70130 United States	29.9474	-90.068	['lady-delaney', 'thedelaportes']	2015-11-16 00:00:00		"['WIENXTRA-Spielebox ', ""Seven's Pinballorama"", 'Meow Wolf Convergence Station', '76th Street Subway Station']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/escape-my-room-2
