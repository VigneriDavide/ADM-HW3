Grafton Ghost Town	['ghost-towns', 'abandoned']	1108	374	Theso-called Dixie region of Utah wassettled by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the directionof Brigham Young, who thought the region would yielda profitable cotton crop.The town of Grafton was settled a few miles south of Zion National Park on the Virgin River in 1859 by five The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints families, but they soon had to scale back cotton production in favor of food crops. Then in1862, the Virgin River flooded and washed away the entire town, but the tenacious settlers reestablished Grafton about a mile upstream.In 1866, conflicts with the Black Hawkand other native peoples led Brigham Young to call on all settlements to combine into towns of at least 150 people. Grafton was abandoned, but farmers still came to tend their crops. Two years later, settlers returned and built the adobe schoolhouse, which still stands today.The population of the Graftonshrank as young people moved away in search of new farmland or other livelihoods until it was completely abandoned again in the 20th century.Today Grafton isaghost town, and one that has enjoyed a few moments in the spotlight.Several movies were shot in thisabandoned frontier settlement, including several scenes from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the 1929 film In Old Arizona,the first talkie filmed outdoors. Descendants of the people who lived here still gather for an annual reunion to keep the spirit of this frontier village alive though only four buildings and the cemetery remain.The graveyard is a picturesque reminder of the hard lives of the Old Westsettlers belowthe grand sandstone spiresand blue skies of southern Utah.	Settled by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1859, this abandoned frontier town has appeared in several films.  	['Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel', 'The Narrows', 'Pioneer Heritage Museum']	1717 W Main St Rockville, Utah United States	37.1672	-113.0799	['jon2-9e71840d-506e-45d2-8b53-eb6b8b7b7413', 'breaingram']	2016-10-19 00:00:00	"[""22\xa0of America's Best Preserved Ghost Towns""]"	['Kiosk Ghost Town', 'Warm Springs Ghost Town', 'Volcano Historic Boomtown', 'Old Irontown']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grafton-ghost-town
