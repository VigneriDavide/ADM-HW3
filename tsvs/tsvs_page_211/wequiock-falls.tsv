Wequiock Falls	['waterfalls', 'water']	668	242	This amazing hidden waterfall just off the I-43 highway is a greatpit stop to stop and explore. One of the Lake Michigan Waterfalls, it’s a result of the Niagara Escarpment. It’s best to visit in the spring but also has fascinatingice structures during the winter months. An old bridge stretches above the falls with stone stairs leading down into the gorge.	A lovely hidden waterfall right off the highway is well worth a stop. 	['Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan', 'Hamburger Charlie', 'This Big One']	3426 Bay Settlement Rd Green Bay, Wisconsin United States	44.5685	-87.8792	['edac112233', 'lost-dolly']	2016-05-20 00:00:00		['Bufadero La Garita', 'Burney Falls ', 'Charco Azul', 'Tinuy-An Falls']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wequiock-falls
