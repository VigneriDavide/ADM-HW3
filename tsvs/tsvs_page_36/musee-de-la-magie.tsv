Musee de la Magie	['marquis-de-sade', 'amazing-automata', 'magic', 'collections']	1698	260	The Museum of Magic and Curiosity is a private collection of optical illusions, fun house mirrors, wind-up toys, and historical magic artifacts located in the Marais. Paired with the Musée des Automates, it also houses a terrific collection of over one hundred 19th and 20th-century automatons. There is, however, a dark side to the museum.The collection is housed in the 16th-century vaulted cellar of what was once the Marquis De Sade’s house. Sade lived in the building as a young man and developed the beginnings of his notorious sexual appetite there. Today the museum’s whimsical holdings are a delightful counterpart to its sadist history, and are appropriate for adults and children alike. Every tour concludes with a magic show.	A museum of magic with a Sadist past. 	[' Cannonball of the Hotel de Sens ', 'Maison de Victor Hugo', 'Musée Carnavalet']	11 Rue Saint-Paul  Paris, 75004 France	48.8532	2.3614	['mbison', 'michelle']	2008-11-21 00:00:00		['Museum of the Bizarre ', 'Buckland Museum of Witchcraft and Magick', 'Monster Kabinett', 'The Table That Could Talk To The Dead ']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musee-de-la-magie
