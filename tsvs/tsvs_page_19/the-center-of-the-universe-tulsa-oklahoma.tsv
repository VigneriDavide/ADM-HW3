The Center of the Universe	['sounds', 'geographic-markers', 'science', 'monuments']	2223	929	The so-calledCenter of the Universe in downtownTulsais marked by a smallconcrete circle in themiddle of a largercircle ofbricks.It’s not much to look at, but looking isn’t really the point.The “Center of the Universe” is a little-known mysterious acoustic phenomenon. Ifyoustand in the middleof the circle and make a noise, thesound is echoed back several times louder than it was made. It’s your own private amplified echo chamber.As the legend goes, a foghorn could be going off in the center of the circle and those on the outside wouldn’t hear it. This may be an exaggeration, butyour voice does soundextremelydistorted when heard from outside the circle. It’s an incredible effect.Like the Lake George Mystery Spot—anotheracoustical vortex that seems to defy the laws of physics—the effect is thought to becaused by the sound reflecting off acircularwall, in this case a nearby planter. Still, though many people have studied the cause ofthe odd anomalythere’sno clear consensus. Whatever the causes of this natural sonic distortion may be, it is truly an amazing place.	An acoustic anomaly with a mysterious cause. 	['Woody Guthrie Center', 'BOK Tower', 'Cain’s Ballroom']	20 E Archer St Tulsa, Oklahoma United States	36.1569	-95.9915	['collector-of-experiences']	2016-10-06 00:00:00	['Favorites']	['Geographic Center of Europe', 'Oskar Kleins Gastbok', 'Marco do Equador', 'Marco do Descobrimento (Discovery Landmark)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-center-of-the-universe-tulsa-oklahoma
