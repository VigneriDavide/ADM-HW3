Dripstone Wall	['secret-passages', 'grottoes', 'walls', 'gardens', 'plants']	2228	775	Resting atthe heart of Prague’s baroque palace grounds is a famously eeriewall, surrounded by lush gardens.Constructed at the behest of Albrecht von Wallenstein between1623 and 1630, theWallenstein Palace enjoyeda centuries-long first life as a magnificent private residence for various generations of the Wallenstein family. At the close of World War II, the landfell into the hands of the state government, who repurposed the palace’s main buildings to serve as the seat of operation for the Senate of Czechia.Despite the elite negotiations that have always taken place inside the palace’s handsome corridors, it is theWallenstein Palace’s massive network of complex, geometric gardens that remain the biggest draw forthe public since 2002. Fashioned in an early baroque style, the grounds were partitioned into several distinct areas, the most secluded and fascinating of whichwas known as “The Grotto.”In this portion of the garden, aspectsof real and artificial elements of nature co-mingle, creating an eerily unreal landscape. Here, grotesques were allowed to reign supreme, including imagery of snakes, monsters, and random, distorted faces, while an aviary provided a crucial acoustic element.Contemporary visitors to theGrotto remainmost struck by the Dripstone Wall, created by things that,from a distance, seem to be dripping skulls. Closer investigation reveals the wall is made from ahaunting, uncanny assemblage of stalactite-like rocks. Signsalong the wall note that, if one stares hard enough, it’s possible to make out human and animal faces peering out from within the wall’s recesses.Adding further fuel to the site’s disconcerting nature are otherstrategically placed clues that the Dripstone Wallitselfcould, perhaps, contain secret passageways wending through its interior, accessible only by those bright enough to discern the pattern of access.Throughout nearly 500 yearsof years of existence, no one seems to have found a way in,but, thankfully, that hasn’t yet stopped visitors from dreaming about solving the mystery.	Countless grotesque faces stare out from this eerie Prague art wall. 	['Vojan Gardens', 'J.A.
