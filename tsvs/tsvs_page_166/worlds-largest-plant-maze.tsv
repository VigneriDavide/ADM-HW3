World's Largest Plant Maze	['mazes', 'shops']	780	552	Almost two and a half miles of paths weave through two acres of native plants to form the largest plant maze in the world. The current Guinness record holder, the Pineapple Maze at the Dole pineapple plantation had to expand in 2007 to win back the title.The maze originally debuted in 1998, and now features more than 14,000 plants. It was designed as a game with eight stations to be visited, and a pineapple shaped garden at the center. The fastest times through the maze are posted on a sign at the entrance. For most visitors it takes about an hour, but the record time to complete this record maze is just seven minutes.	Race through the maze, get your name on the sign.Â 	['Kukaniloko Birthstones', 'Aiea Cemetery', 'Site of the Japanese WWII Surrender']	64-1550 Kamehameha Hwy Wahiawa, Hawaii, 96786 United States	21.526	-158.0376	['annetta-black', 'hrnick']	2013-07-16 00:00:00		"['Cool Patch Pumpkins Corn Maze', 'Wizard Quest', 'Green Thumb', ""Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/worlds-largest-plant-maze
