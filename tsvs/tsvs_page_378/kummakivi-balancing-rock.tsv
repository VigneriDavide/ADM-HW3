Kummakivi Balancing Rock	['rocks', 'geology']	429	32	The Kummakivi (Finnish for“strange rock”) can be found balanced upon another rock in the middle of the forest.This strange sight perplexed visitors since its discovery, and spawned stories of giants having balanced the rock in its position, but geologists have a more realisticexplanation: glaciers. This isn’t the first balancing rock to be discovered, and scientists believe that glaciers - capable of carrying such a heavy rock with them - left it behind as they receded to the North over 8,000 years ago. The power of glacierstrumps even giants.	Legend has this precariously placed rock was placed by giants. Science has another explanation. 	['Imatrankoski', 'Astuvansalmi Rock Paintings', 'Veijo Rönkkönen Sculpture Garden']	Ruokolahti, 56310 Finland	61.4935	28.4294	['samr', 'hrnick']	2014-05-25 00:00:00	['13 Places to Celebrate Erratic Behavior']	['La Pierre Percée', 'Incandescent Rocks', 'Castor River Shut-Ins', 'Painted Rock']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kummakivi-balancing-rock
