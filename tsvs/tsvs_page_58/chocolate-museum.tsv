Chocolate Museum	['food-museums', 'collections', 'food', 'museums']	1358	506	Five hundredyears ago, chocolate in the form of cocoa beans first came ashore in Europe. Coming into port in Spain, Hernan Cortes and his conquistadors brought the spiced treat with them after pillaging the Mayan and Aztec empires of Central America, where cocoa beans had been used to create chocolate variants for over 3,000 years.In honor of this trans-Atlantic transfer, the Barcelona Confectionery Guild has set up the Chocolate Museum to tell the story of chocolate and its modernization. Although the history section of the museum is in no way perfect, visitors get a general trajectory of chocolate’s evolution, moving from bitter water to the stunningly detailed sculptures that fill the museum. By using the statues to visibly depict modern chocolate innovation, the arc of the history of chocolate feels fairly complete.Upon entrance to the museum, guests are greeted by a massive white chocolate ape named Snowy, along with their own chocolate bar as part of their admission. As they munch onthe confectioner’s chocolate, guests walk past glass-encased sculptures made entirely of chocolate. The sculptures include some famous cultural icons such as Minnie Mouse and Louis Armstrong. However, the bulk of work focuses on Spanish architecture, proudly featuring Sagrada Familia, one of Gaudi’s famous houses, and creatures from Parc Guell.Combining history, the world’s favorite treat, and a small dash of Spanish pride, the museum offers something for every chocolate lover.	Gaze upon chocolate sculptures depicting everything from chariot races to Gaudí's famous church at this shrine to sweets. 	['European Museum of Modern Art', 'Palau Dalmases', 'FC Barcelona Coat of Arms']	Comerç, 36  Barcelona, 08003 Spain	41.3873	2.1819	['serflac', 'atimian']	2011-09-27 00:00:00		"[""Pizza Brain's Museum of Pizza Culture"", 'Baked Bean Museum of Excellence', 'National Cookie Cutter Historical Museum', 'World’s Oldest Edible Ham']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chocolate-museum
