It was placed in a very fitting location on a seafood restaurant on Salmon Street.The absurdity of an oversized metal salmon crashing through the brickwork of a popular restaurant is not lost on those who notice it, though its location on the 3rd floor of the building means that it is often overlooked by passersby.
