Statue of King Wenceslas Riding an Upside-Down Dead Horse	['david-cerny', 'statues', 'art']	822	1138	Hanging from the ceiling of the Art Nouveau Lucerna Palace in Prague, an ancient king rides triumphantly astride… an upside-down, apparently dead horse.Created by Prague-born artist DavidČerný, whose claim to fame was the painting a Soviet tank pink as a memorial to the Velvet Revolution, he’s also known for his unsettling large scale installation piece of babies crawling their way up the Prague television tower, among other works of modern surrealism.The sculpture is a mocking reference to the more famous equestrian statue of King (and later, Saint) Wenceslas thatsits in Wenceslas Square, and possibly a mocking nod to Czech president Vaclav Klaus, although the artist will not say what his intentions were.	A mocking tribute to the past and modern leadership of Prague. 	"['Prague Pneumatic Post', ""Hlava Franze Kafky (Franz Kafka's Head)"", 'Jan Palach Memorial']"	Lucerna Palace 36 Vodičkova Prague Czechia	50.0814	14.4254	['3148delct', 'annetta-black']	2013-05-07 00:00:00		['Brown-Nosers', 'Hostina Obrů (Feast of Giants)', 'Trifot', 'Man Hanging Out']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/statue-of-king-wenceslas-riding-an-upsidedown-dead-horse
