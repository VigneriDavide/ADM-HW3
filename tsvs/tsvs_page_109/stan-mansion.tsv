Stan Mansion	['freemasons', 'mansions', 'history', 'architecture']	993	277	Chicago has a rich history of men of all walks of life involved in Freemasonry, since the first Masoniclodge was built in the city in 1843. Upon closer inspection, you will find that many buildings and homes still in use today were once Masonic buildings.One such example isStan Mansion, a grandiosebuildingoriginally erectedin 1923 to house a chapter ofthe Knights Templar, the Humboldt Park Commandery No. 79. The Knights Templar is one of manyfraternal ordersaffiliated with the Freemasons, dating back tothe Crusades in the 18th century.TheTemple took just six months to construct, and remained a Masonic lodge for a mostof its years. It was eventually purchased byitscurrent owner Cera Stan, whorestored the building to its original splendor, and repurposed it as a popular event venuein what’s now Chicago’s Logan Square Historic District.Justnext door to Stan Mansion is thehistoric William Nowaczewski House, a largeQueen Anne three-story greystone, replete with a medieval tower, which was builtin 1897 and spans three city lots. The home is eye-catching sight to visitors of the area, and still retains many of its original interior features: beautifulinlaid hardwood floors, an ornately carved wooden staircase, stained glass windows and an elaborate lobby rotunda.These grand structures are relics of the golden ageof development in the district, which boomed between 1889 and 1930 before the Great Depression hit. During this period well-to-do businessmen built finely crafted mansions along the boulevards that outline Logan Square, many of which have preserved their original late 19th and early 20th century character and architectural styles. Thankfully, we have the opportunity to enjoy their grandeureven today.	Built to house a chapter of the Knights Templar, this grandiose building is a relic of Freemasonry in Chicago a century ago. 	"['Busy Beaver Button Co.', ""Walt Disney's Chicago Birthplace"", 'North Avenue Baths Facade']"	2408 North Kedzie Boulevard Chicago, Illinois, 60647 United States	41.9251	-87.7081	['yamweb', '3ad7840d-e0a8-4603-b61f-ddeb08ece036']	2016-05-28 00:00:00	['Novus Ordo Seclorum: 14 Places to Unearth Masonic Secrets']	['Vishrambaug Wada', 'Ungurmuiža Manor', 'Filoli', 'Nazaretian House']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stan-mansion
