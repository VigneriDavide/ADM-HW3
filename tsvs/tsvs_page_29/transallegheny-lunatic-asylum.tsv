Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum	['abandoned-insane-asylums', 'ruins', 'architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	1881	516	The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, which changed names over the years and was known as the Weston State Hospital later in life—operated from 1864 to 1994.Today it stands as a testimony to the inhumane practices once used in mental health. Sitting on 26.5 acres, this spooky area is home to numerous buildings, including a museum, a gift shop where a few of the remaining employees still work, and an abandoned cemetery.Famous for its looming structure, it was built using the Kirkbride design, a design common to asylums of the early 19th century.Much of the asylum remains closed off to the general public as the main building and out-buildings are in bad repair and are structurally unsound.A wide choice oftoursare available, and specialty supernatural/ghost hunts, even overnighters are available for those searching for tortured spirits who have yet to escape.	A particularly creepy abandoned hospital that sparks interest for lovers of the supernatural. 	['Blenko Man', 'Brandy Gap Tunnel #2', 'Zinc Smelter']	50 S River Ave Weston, West Virginia, 26452 United States	39.0388	-80.4712	['cinapelayo', 'tekkbabe859']	2013-05-08 00:00:00		['Riverview Hospital', 'Valerian Wall at Niche Hotel', 'Klafthmonos Square Parking Structure Fortification Walls', 'Ex-Monastery of Santiago Apóstol']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/transallegheny-lunatic-asylum
