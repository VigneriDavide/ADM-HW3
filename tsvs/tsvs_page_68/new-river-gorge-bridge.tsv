New River Gorge Bridge	['extreme-sports', 'national-parks', 'infrastructure', 'bridges']	1257	1210	Ranking among Earth’sfinest mega-bridges, the New River Gorge Bridge can be challenging enough tomotorists’ bravery simply when driving across. Butone day each year it takes thrill-seeking to a whole new level when BASE jumpers from all over the world cling to its girders and fling themselves off in a massive festival made specialfor its legality, of all things.Built in 1977 to connect the hills on either side of West Virginia’s New River Gorge, the bridgewas, for years, the world’s longest single-span arch bridge made of steel (today it ranks fourth) and the highest vehicular bridge in the world. A marvel of engineering, the New River Gorge Bridge isa staggering 3,030 feet long and rises 876feet above the rapids below.It only took two years after the bridge opened for someone to realize it made a great place to intentionally throw oneself off of (with the intention of surviving). That man wascoal mine foreman Burton Ervin, who BASE jumped from the bridge to much attention from the local press and famously suggested, “They’re going to keep coming.Might as well try to make some money off of it.”Thus was born the annual tradition of Bridge Day.Every third Saturday in October since 1980, the New River Gorge Bridge becomes the only place in the National Parks Service dominion where it is legal to BASE jump. The first years sawonly five jumpers, and one hit the rocks. In a fluke twist for a sport known for its fatalities, he walked away with a broken jaw and missing most of his teeth, but dismissedofficials’ concerns that the fledgling festival was “dangerous” byinsisting to aCharleston Daily Mailreporter that BASE jumping was “safer than marriage.”In its present incarnation, Bridge Day’s participants are capped at 450, with strict rules as to how many skydives they must have under their belts before BASE jumping at the bridge. Spectators numberin the tens of thousands, partly to watch daredevils fling themselves into the ravine below, but also to enjoy familiarscenery from a new vantage point, as the festivalmarks the only day in which foot traffic of any kind ispermittedon the bridge.In December 2020, New River Gorge National Park and Preserve was officially established as the United States’s 63rd national park.	One day a year it is legal to jump off of this astoundingly tall bridge that spans an Appalachian gorge. 	['Kaymoor Mines', 'Nuttallburg', 'Mystery Hole']	U.S. 19 Fayetteville, West Virginia, 25840 United States	38.0683	-81.0833	['rellehcim', 'cblakewest']	2015-08-12 00:00:00		['Las Coloradas Bridge', 'Ura e Terzive', 'Pickering Pedestrian Bridge', 'Truck-Eating Bridge']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-river-gorge-bridge
