Hamburg Paper Mill Ruins	['industrial', 'ruins']	593	192	In the backyard of the well-known (at least to locals)abandoned Gingerbread Castle in Northern New Jersey stands a lesser known but expansive ruin: the remainsof the former Hamburg paper mill.Completed in 1874 along the Wallkill River, the paper mill flourished as an industry creating tissue paper to pack fruit. The river was dammed, creating power for the mill, which was locatedclose to the railroad so products could easilybe shipped.The mill met its demise aftermultiple fires and persistent flooding in thearea. Today, the smokestack can still be seen from the road, and you can make out some of the original lettering, which once read:“Union Waxed and Parchment Paper Company.” The large iron wheel that probably powered the mill is still nestled on the property.You can see a videowith more exploration of the site here.	Tucked behind New Jersey's abandoned Gingerbread Castle lie the eerie ruins of a once-flourishing paper mill.  	['The Gingerbread Castle', 'Fluorescent Rocks of Sterling Hill Mine', 'The Ghost Bridge of Oak Ridge Reservoir']	Hamburg, New Jersey United States	41.1428	-74.5755	['57butler', 'jm-sith']	2017-04-24 00:00:00		['Stone Edge Cupola', 'Knežev Arsenal', 'El Charco del Ingenio (The Mill Puddle)', 'Aldridge Sawmill']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hamburg-paper-mill-ruins
