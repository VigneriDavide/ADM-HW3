Museum of Unnatural History	['cryptozoology', 'purveyors-of-curiosities', 'lost-wonders', 'shops', 'art', 'museums']	778	124	Now closed, the Museum of Unnatural History wasnot your run of the mill museum giftshop; that is of course, unless you consider a can of “primordial soup” a typical souvenir. The merchandise available spannedthe imaginary past to the possibly made up future. Guests could perusethe hybrid animal fossils and melancholy jarred unicorn tears, or get ready for theirown explorations by stocking up on soft, two-ply rolls of “field journals.”The retail store supported826DC, one of the eight branches of 826 National, the children’s writing and tutoring center developed by the creators of McSweeney’s literary journal. As of December 2015, the headquarters of 826DC moved to Tivoli’s Astounding Magic Supply Co. across the street, and thus, the secret of The Cave may remainshrouded forever.Update: The Museum of Unnatural History is permanently closed.	Giftshop catering to cryptozoologists and anyone with a sense of humor. 	"[""Tivoli's Astounding Magic Supply"", 'Washington Family Church National Cathedral', 'Warder-Totten House']"	3233 14TH St. NW Washington, D.C., 20010 United States	38.9302	-77.0321	['hjhausman', 'edgardopagan1976']	2012-04-24 00:00:00		"['The Noguchi Museum', 'Daredevil Tattoo Museum', 'Casa del Oro', ""Pollock's Toy Museum""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-unnatural-history
