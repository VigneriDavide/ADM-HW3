United Palace Theatre	['movie-palace', 'theater', 'performances', 'theaters', 'churches', 'sacred-spaces', 'art', 'history', 'architecture']	1620	331	The Wonder Theatres were five giant, lavishmovie palaces that opened aroundNew York City in 1929 and 1930. While cinemas were plentiful at the time, the Wonder Theatres were a cut above the rest. Built asLoew’s flagship theatres, the opulent venues were designed with all the fabulousness of the Jazz Age, and went on to provide an escape into the fantasyof Hollywood and luxury throughout the Great Depression and Second World War.The last of the Wonder Theatres to open was the Loew’s 175th Street Theatre, today known as the United Palace Theater. It debuted on February 22, 1930, with showings of the films Their Own Desire and Pearls andvaudeville performances starring Al Shaw and Sam Lee. The theater is a sight to behold.The lavish interior, much of which is filigreed, features authentic Louis XV and XVI furnishings and ornate chandeliers, whilethe blocky exterior is reminiscent of Mayan architecture. Itseclectic architectural style, designed by Thomas W. Lamb, was described byThe New York Timesas “Byzantine-Romanesque-Indo-Hindu-Sino-Moorish-Persian-Eclectic-Rococo-Deco” and a “kitchen sink masterpiece.”Withmore than 3,000 seats, it is still the fourth largest venue of its kind in Manhattan.Movie palaces eventually fellout of vogue, however, and the grand Wonder Theatres fell into decline and abandon in the late 60s and throughthe 70s. Today, two of the theaters (the Jersey Theatre in Jersey City and Kings Theatre in Brooklyn) still serve as cinemas and performancevenues. Another two (the Paradise Theatre in the Bronx and Valencia Theatre in Queens) became churches. The United Palace Theater, located in upper Manhattan’s Washington Heights, found a second life asa unique mix of both.Soon after Loew’s closed the venue in 1969 (the last film shown was 2001: A Space Odyssey) it waspurchased by televangelist preacher Reverend Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter II, aka“Reverend Ike.” Herenamed it the Palace Cathedral, though it became known as “Reverend Ike’s Prayer Tower.”The restorations included fixing the “Wonder Morton” pipe organ, a feature of all of the Wonder Theatres, which had gone unused for 25 years. (It has since fallen out of use again due to water damage.) Reverend Ike made only one significant change to the structure, adding a cupola to the northeast corner of the building, topped with a “Miracle Star of Faith” that is visible from New Jersey.The former Wonder Theatre still functions as a church, as well as a movie house with a 50-foot screen, and a performance venue that has brought in acts as diverse as Adele, Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, and the Berlin Philharmonic. It also servesas a cultural and community arts center, opened by Reverend Ike’s son Xavier Eikerenkoetter, who now oversees operations of the historic venue.
