A “hands on” museum, every exhibit is also playable, free of charge with your entry fee. One of theoldest pinball machines in the collection is the “Screwball” which dates to 1948 when the flippers were made to point outwards. One of the early machines with flippers they were added as part of the movement of pinball machines from pure gambling devices to games of skill.Started with a small collection of 10 pinball machinesdonated by board memberSteve Bowrey, the museum has grown extensively over the years. A labor of love, much of the work done on the machines as well as building out the handcrafted bar was done by volunteers who contributed $2,500 in time and labor rather than cash.	This collection of over 50 classic pinball machines awaits visitors to downtown Roanoke. 	['Miniature Graceland', 'Roanoke Star', 'Sharp Top Crash Site']	One Market Square SE Roanoke Pinball Museum Roanoke, Virginia United States	37.2715	-79.9395	['crader', 'rugby007']	2016-07-27 00:00:00		['Asheville Pinball Museum', 'Flipper Muzeum', 'American Classic Arcade Museum', 'Pinball Hall of Fame']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/roanoke-pinball-museum
