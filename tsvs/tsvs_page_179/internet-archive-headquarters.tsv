Internet Archive Headquarters	['forgotten-digital-wonders', 'internet', 'technology']	747	189	With the stated mission of providing “universal access to all knowledge,” the Internet Archive is one of history’smost ambitious cataloging projects. So far millions of books, movies, television, music, software, and video games have been collected and digitized by theproject, and that’s not counting the billions of websites they’ve been archiving over the past two decades with theWayback Machine.Fitting of such an ambitious project, thearchive’s brick-and-mortar headquarters are also quitegrand. The old Christian Scientist church in San Francisco’s Richmond district was chosen largely because the church’s front resembled the Internet Archive’s logo: the Library of Alexandria’s Greek columns. Inside the beautiful building you’ll find dozens of employees and volunteers digitizing everything fromold home movies, to old LPs, to 8-bit video games.Inside the church’s main room, with its still-intact pews, there are more than120 ceramic sculptures of the Internet Archive’s current and former employees, created by artist Nuala Creed and inspired by the statues of the Xian warriors in China. Among the figures is internet pioneer Ted Nelson, the late genius hacktivist Aaron Swartz, as well as Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle. Also found in this room are some clever art projects, such as a “zip line” (a zip disk on a fishing line), by the organization’s artist-in-residence, as well as some of the archive’s massive servers, which also serve as the building’s heaters.	The grand, column-fronted, sculpture-adorned home of the ambitious digital library. 	['Arion Press and M & H Type', 'United States Marine Hospital Cemetery', 'Heroes Grove Memorial']	300 Funston Ave San Francisco, California, 94118 United States	37.7823	-122.4716	['leiris', 'james-ricci']	2017-05-02 00:00:00		['Fucino Space Centre', 'Alpine Inn', 'Internet Antennas of Christ the King ', 'Birthplace of the Web']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/internet-archive-headquarters
