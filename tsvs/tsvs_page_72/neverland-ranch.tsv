Neverland Ranch	['michael-jackson', 'abandoned-amusement-parks', 'celebrity', 'intriguing-environs', 'music', 'ecosystems']	1228	189	The once whimsicalplay-landof the late pop superstar Michael Jackson is now abandoned, the amusement park rides quiet and the grounds overgrown.Years since Jackson left his sequestered estate which he acquired in 1987, the once colorful buildings and rides of Neverland Ranch are bleached from the sun, and the exotic animals once kept on the premises are gone. In its heyday, it had over 50 full-time employees and a regular rotation of children invited to play.While other millionaires have expressed interest in purchasing it, and there have been proposals to turn it into a memorial museum, so far no deals have come through.
