What emerged from this vision has persisted as the world’s oldest charitable social housing complex.In the year 1517, construction began on Fugger’svision for what would becomethegolden-walled enclave of Fuggerei, which he createdas a way of providing affordable homesfor day laborers, artisans and theirfamilies. Though itsustained heavy damage during a bombing raid in WWII, the community was restored to its pre-raid condition, where it has remained uninterruptedly inhabited since its founding in 1520.The city-within-a-city consists of private residences including67 houses, 147 apartments, St. Mark’s Church, and an administrative building.In the half-millennia since Fuggerei’s inception, the community has become one of Augsburg’s most popular destinations. For just€4, visitors are given a tour behind the walls, including a glimpse insideone single apartment left intentionally uninhabited for voyeuristicpurposes.All this accessfeels likea bargain price untila simple calculation reveals one’s admission ticket costs more thanfour times the annual rent of Fuggerei’s residents.Yes, that’s right: Rent herecosts just 88 euro cents for an entire year.There is a catch, of course.
