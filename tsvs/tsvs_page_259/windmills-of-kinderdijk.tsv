Windmills of Kinderdijk	['folktales', 'windmills', 'unesco', 'engineering']	581	457	Think “Holland” and you’ve probably already conjured the iconic images of tulips and windmills. More precisely, the very specific windmills you’re envisioning right now are that of Kinderdijk.Though it may sound odd for how technical and pragmatic the region proved to be, the name Kinderdijk translates in Dutch to mean “children’s dike.” According to local legend, aftera particularly terrible floodin the 15th century, a lone basket was left floating in an inundated canal. Upon closer inspection, a cat was found bounding from one side of the basket to the other in an effort to keep it balanced, for inside rested an orphaned baby. The cat had kept the babe afloat, safe and sound during its journey… Thus giving the world the folktale “The Cat and the Cradle” in addition tothe village of Kinderdijk its name.Back in the modern day, visitors will find19 historically authentic windmills scattered across Kinderdijk’s canal-riddledlandscape. With their sails raised to the skies (coming to rest in formations that communicate across the bogs in a language ofsemafors), one could be forgiven for believing these are creatures beholden to the air. What history reveals, in fact, is that the Netherlands’ famous windmills are well-disguisedcreatures of the sea, without which thenation’s famously innovativewater management system would not have been possible.Sometime in the 13th century,Zuid-Holland’speat rivers ceased to drain as they had been, creating a pattern of flooding that devastated the beautiful landscape atAlblasserwaard, which already existed below sea level. Berms were built to prevent flooding, but pumping stations needed to be constructed to continue water flow from low to high areas; hence, the 19th windmills still seen today.Nowhere else in the world offers a completeportrait of early water managementlike that of Kinderdijk, which accounts for UNESCO’s inclusionof the site among its World Heritage as of1997 for its “unique character.” Thanks to its truly groundbreaking unification of sea and sky, plus the added bonus of a world-renowned folktale, a visit to Kinderdijk is the sort of treasure that offers something for dreamers and pragmatists alike.
