Kilmogue Portal Tomb	['megalithic', 'catacombs-and-crypts', 'monuments', 'ruins']	476	64	At 18 feet tall, the Kilmogue Portal Tomb is an impressive feat of megalithic stone construction.The Kilmogue tomb – also called the Harristown Dolmen or Leac An Scail – is the tallest dolmen (a single-chamber tomb usually surrounded by three standing stones) in Ireland. Most dolmens were built around 3000 BC, and despitetheir being widely accepted to be burial sitesthere is little concrete evidence to identify them as actual tombs. Whatever the site’s true purpose, the Kilmogue tomb’s massive standing stones remain as a site that inspires awe in most visitors.	Huge standing stones mark a site of megalithic mystery. 	['The Lost Town of Newtown Jerpoint (Jerpoint Park)', 'Jerpoint Abbey', 'Kells Priory']	Unnamed Road Kilkenny Ireland	52.4057	-7.2781	['barnumbrownie', 'martin--2']	2012-08-23 00:00:00		['Drombeg Stone Circle', 'Shah-i-Zinda Necropolis', 'Citadelle Laferrière', 'Dolmen of Aguas Tuertas']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kilmogue-portal-tomb
