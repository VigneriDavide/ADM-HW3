The Holy Land Experience	['wax-museum', 'religious-parks', 'biblical']	528	254	At Orlando’s Holy Land Experience, Jesus is crucified daily for your viewing pleasure.This sprawling theme park, owned and operated by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, was founded as a non-profit corporation with the mission to create “aliving, biblical museum that takes you 7000 miles away and 2000 years back in time to the land of the Bible.”All features of the park are toutedas “exact replicas” of the way they would have been found during1st century Judea. Debates about the indeterminatenature of saidauthenticity aside, thesemodelsof major sites from the New and Old Testament weredesigned with enough intricate detail toprovide visitorswith a clear understanding of their historic and religioussignificance. Pilgrims to the parkroam through a profusion of temples,a model of Jerusalem itself, theQumran Dead Sea Caves, the Wilderness Tabernacle, and the Garden Tomb from which Jesus resurrected.A visit to the Holy Land Experience is designed to be extremely participatory. Between traditional Bible studies classes, depictions of 1st century shopping atthe Old Scroll Shop, sharing communion with Jesus’ disciplesat a recreation of The Last Supper, particularly gory reenactments of the crucifixion, andperformances by the“Century musical team”, there’s something to interpellate everyone.Rather than leaving such wanderings as provenance of the mind, the Holy Land Experience allows the devout to explore the birthplace of Christianity as it appeared back in the day in a physical sense that may be as close as anyone is going to get… at least until the Good Lord delivers that time machine we’ve all been praying for.	A mega theme park-wax museum mélange containing all things biblical. 	['Randall Knife Museum', 'Global Convergence Sculpture', 'The Disney Collection']	4655 Vineland Road Orlando, Florida, 32811 United States	28.4962	-81.433	['blembitz', 'atak']	2015-07-20 00:00:00	['The Best of Weird Florida']	['BibleWalk Wax Museum', 'Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden', 'Tisch Family Zoological Park ', 'Tu Viện A Nan ']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-holy-land-experience-orlando-florida
