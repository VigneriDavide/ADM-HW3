Smithsonian Sushi Collection	['food-museums', 'government', 'food', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums', 'history']	527	117	The American History Museum has collected an assortment of sushi ephemera as the Japanese dishgained popularity in the U.S. over the past few decades. Why collect sushi at ahistory museum? If you take a step back you’ll remember thatculinary trends come and go throughout the ages. After all, early Americansconsumed vast amounts of game and alcohol; only a fool would have thought about eating raw fish.At theSmithsonian’sSushi Collection, each sushi artifact is dutifully cataloged, measured, and accompanied bya detailed description for future historians. It may seem boring today, but think about how interesting it can be to pore over culturalrelics from the past like 1960s appliances, World War II propaganda posters, or vintage Coca-Cola ads.Consider the museum’sdescription of a “Sushi Tray, Small”:The two part container has a black tray with a detailed red and gold maple leaf pattern and a clear plastic lid. The clear plastic counterpart is shaped to leave space for the sushi inside, and allows for the contents of the tray to remain visible to the customers. This is an example of a small sushi tray used for packaging sushi.These trays often contain a variety of rolls and nigiri, and include a side of wasabi and gari (pickled ginger) as condiments. Upon purchase, the customer is provided with a pair of disposable chopsticks and a single serving packet of soy sauce. These trays are disposable, and therefore these prepackaged sushi trays make a convenient lunch option.One can only imagine how, a century from now, the museum’s disposable chopstick exhibit might serve as an important touchstone for the American experience.	Seemingly unremarkable items like empty sushi trays, chef hats, and freshness stickers are being preserved so future generations can look back on this beloved cultural import. 	"['Cher Ami', ""General Sheridan's Horse Rienzi Winchester"", 'Sergeant Stubby']"	14th Streed and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, District of Columbia United States	38.8907	-77.03	['elliot-carter', 'thebodyinthelibrary']	2017-01-31 00:00:00	['The Ultimate List of Wonderfully Specific Museums']	['Gurkenmuseum (Cucumber Museum)', 'Indian River Citrus Museum', 'First Peanut Museum in the U.S.', 'Pin Point Heritage Museum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/smithsonian-sushi-collection
