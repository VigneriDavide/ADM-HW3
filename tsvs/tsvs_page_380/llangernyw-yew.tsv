Llangernyw Yew	['world-s-oldest-trees', 'fauna', 'trees', 'ancient', 'plants', 'animals']	427	75	The Llangernyw Yew is an ancient tree, growing in Conwy, Wales. The tree is estimated to be between 4,000 and5,000 years old, although dating yew trees is notoriously difficult thanks to the tree’s core having been lost to theages. Itscleft trunk appears as a living portal to the world of the dead, with a small field of tombstones resting just on the other side of wooded gateway.Were its true age to approach the older side of the spectrum, this dates the yew to the Bronze Age, before Christianity’s arrival in the British Isles. This makes the Llangernyw Yew a likely candidate for one of the oldest still-standing trees in Great Britain. Due in no small part to this, the yewwas designated as one of the Fifty Great British Trees in 2002.Adding to the tree’s mystique is its role into Welshmythology, according to which the tree is often associated with a spirit known asAngelystor, or the “Recording Angel.” Each year at Halloween the Angel speaksa prophecy foretellingthe names of parishioners destined to die before the next Halloweenfrom the altar of a nearbychurch. Those wishing to find if their names were among the angel’s list gather beneath the east window of the church, and listen very closely.Theyew’sspirit of Angelystorhas yet to be scientifically tested, but similiar to the tree’s age,comes backed bythousands of years of written record attesting to its existence.	One of the world's oldest trees comes with a Welsh legend intertwining it with a spirit prophesying death. 	['Laburnum Arch', 'Surf Snowdonia ', 'Remains of the Dolgarrog Dam Disaster']	Llangernyw Saint Digain Conwy, Wales, LL22 8PQ United Kingdom	53.1923	-3.6851	['chris-white', 'collector-of-experiences']	2015-12-17 00:00:00	['The Oldest Living Things in the World']	['This Big One', 'Fragas do Eume', 'Oak Jozef ', 'Olivastri Millenari']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/llangernyw-yew
