The colorful creation, completedusing 60,000 pieces of glass, begins with an imageof Methuselah the bristlecone pine, one of the world’s oldest livingorganisms, and goes on to depict world events in vivid detail.One of the most intricate panes shows Alexander the Great and his horse Bucephalus, Chinese terra cotta soldiers, and the Cliff Palace in Mesa Verde, Colorado. It alone contains more than 2,500 pieces of glass. There are other influentialleaders and thinkers throughoutthe work: Nelson Mandela, Charles Darwin, Sir Isaac Newton, Mahatma Gandhi, Kublai Khan, Dante Alighieri, and hundreds of others jostle for space on this painstakingly researched glass canvas.
