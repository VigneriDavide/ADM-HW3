Museo Atlántico	['coral-reefs', 'underwater', 'environment', 'sculptures', 'art', 'museums']	498	16	Completely submerged under the Atlantic Ocean, Museo Atlántico is a striking reminder of humans’ ever-changing and often destructive impact on the natural world. And in a bit of irony, these manmadesculptures develop over time as nature affects them.The underwater museum, the first of its kind in Europe, is situated off the coast of the Spanish island of Lanzarote, the easternmost of the Canary Islands. The oceanic exhibition is meant to send amessage about conservation, exploring how to create an ecologically responsible interaction between humans and ocean life.The sculptures, created by British artist Jason deCaires Taylor, illustrate the impact of people’s behavior on the environment:Somefeature a raft of refugees on an uncertain voyage; others show humans posing for selfies or taking pictures.Taylor has also built artificial reefs that marine microorganisms attach to, which both attracts more coral growth and helps protectdelicate natural coral reefs. The concrete in the sculptures is pH-neutral and nontoxic to marine life, meaning it serves as the perfect base for microorganisms to inhabit and form artificial reefs where biodiversity skyrockets in once-barren areas.Seventy sculptures are already in place, and by the completion of the ten phases of installations it’s anticipated that number will bubble up to around 300. In essence this uniquemuseum is itself an evolving ecosystem, a collection of living artworks that change over time with their environment, just as nature changes over time by the actions of humans.	A completely underwater art museum sends a stark message about humans' impact on the environment. 	['Green Lagoon', 'El Diablo Restaurant', 'Timanfaya National Park']	C.
