Each item is presented with a short profile, explaining how it’s prepared and enjoyed in its place of origin. By including foods from around the world, the museum highlights the subjectivity of disgust. Root beer, a favorite in Canada and the United States, is featured because many Europeans think it tastes like toothpaste. Meanwhile,surströmming, a fermented Baltic herring that’s a favorite sandwich topper in Sweden, made the cut for its aroma, which some compare to rotten eggs. There are plenty of opportunities for visitorsto smell and taste select items so they can confront their preconceived notions with firsthand experience.It may be called the Disgusting Food Museum, but the project aims to break down visitors’ notions of disgust through playful exposure and exploration of the unknown. As the museum puts it, “Sharing a meal is the best way to turn strangers into friends.”The Atlas Obscura Podcast is a short, daily celebration of all the world’s strange and wondrous places.
