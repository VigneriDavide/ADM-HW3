Dahlem-Dorf U-Bahn Station Benches	['trains']	523	271	A rowof sexy benches at Berlin’s Dahlem-Dorf U-Bahn stationinvite people to take a seat—although the experience is more about excitementthan comfort.Designed by local artist Wolf van Roy the benches resemble some African fetish statues. TheDahlem area itself is more traditional by architectural style and the station building was built in 1913. Hardly anyonewould imagine then that this traditional farmhouse-looking building would receive this kind of addition.	A traditional U-Bahn station in Berlin gets a string of rather untraditional benches. 	['Berlin Botanical Garden', 'Alliierten Museum ', 'The Bierpinsel']	46 Königin-Luise-Straße Berlin Germany	52.4577	13.29	['ahvenas', 'edwin13ok']	2016-08-05 00:00:00		['The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland Museum', 'Spiral Tunnels at the Big Hill', 'Parkeisenbahn', 'Le Petit Train de La Mure']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dahlemdorf-ubahn-station-benches
