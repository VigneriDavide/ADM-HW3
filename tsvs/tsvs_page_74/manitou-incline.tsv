Manitou Incline 	['mountains', 'nature']	1210	659	The Incline outsideManitou Springs is a one-mile vertical hike—straight up. Over the course of that mile you gain 2,000 feet in elevation. The steepclimb along old cable car tracks is one of the most popular “tough” workouts in the area.Depending on your fitness level it can take between 40 minutes to 2 hours to get to the top, or longer. You can climbup on foot; no climbing equipment is necessary. However, spikes are recommended in the Winter months,especially for the descent. There is a false summit located 2/3 of the way up and the trail is visible from all around Colorado Springs. The Incline connects with Barr Trail at the summit, which will continue 10 miles to the 14,000-foot summit of Pikes Peak, or back down to Manitou Springs. Descending on Barr Trail is highly recommended as going back down the Incline is dangerous.	This super steep hike ascends 2,000 feet in less than a mile.  	['Miramont Castle Museum', 'Manitou Springs Penny Arcade', 'Manitou Mineral Springs']	506 Ruxton Ave Manitou Springs, Colorado, 80829 United States	38.8567	-104.9309	['bnever2busy2byoyo', 'schultz394']	2016-08-19 00:00:00	['18 Colorado Adventures That Will Take Your Breath Away (Literally)']	['Gros Piton', 'Wallowa Lake Tramway', 'Hanging Rock Raptor Observatory', 'Gveleti Waterfall']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/manitou-incline
