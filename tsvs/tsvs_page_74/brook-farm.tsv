Brook Farm	['national-monument', 'utopia-week', 'utopias', 'literature', 'cemeteries', 'abandoned']	1212	248	Located alongside an orphan’scemetery, the former site ofBrook Farm commemoratesthe most famous utopian commune to ever have operated in the United States.Established in West Roxbury in April 1841 by the transcendentalists George and Sophia Ripley, Brook Farm (also known as the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education) sought to equally distribute thetasks of daily life while providing education for all participants; the end goalwas a balance of work and leisure that would, above all, benefit the greater good. Turning a profit from the farm’s agricultural surplus proved a challenge, and Brook Farm was forced to shutter in 1847.Nonetheless, the experiment at Brook Farmplayed a key role in the development of American religious and cultural philosophy.During its heyday, the commune was visited by some of America’s most renowned thinkers of the period,including Charles Anderson Dana, Horace Greeley, Margaret Fuller, and NathanielHawthorne. Hawthorne would ultimately set his novel The Blithedale Romancein a utopian community modeled afterBrook Farm.After its closure, the land would take a turnas a poor farm before becomingtraining grounds duringthe Civil War.Brook Farm’s most enduring reincarnation was that ofan orphanage from 1872 to 1943 and the associated Gethsemane Cemetery, the latter of which still stands today.Whilethe majorityof the original buildings are now gone save for the print shop, Brook Farm remains a fascinating roam through land fraught withlayers of intellectual and emotional history that is distinctly American in nature.
