In the 1800s,Sioux and Northern Cheyenne camped near these unique perforated rocks, which are filled with holes and tunnelscrafted by rainfall and wind over 61 million years.The Medicine Rocks site is populated with chained and isolated arches, and caves and spires reaching 80 feet high and 200 feet across. Native Americans came here in search of medicinal plants, lookout pointsfor hunting bison, and resting spots whiletraveling from the Yellowstone River Valley to the Black Hills. When future President Theodore Roosevelt visited the area in 1883, he described it as, “as fantastically beautiful a place as I have ever seen.”The 320 acres of Medicine Rocksstill offers physical reminders of the past. Youcan find thousands of petroglyphs that predate the arrival of European settlers, along with the signatures of cowpunchers, a sheepherder’s famous profile of a woman with a flower beside a bird, and recent inscriptions of elk, cattle brands, and military mentions.Carving into the rocks isprohibited and park officials ask you be careful not to vandalize the site or disturb earlier markings. Instead,they recommend climbing the “Swiss cheese” rocks and taking in the sights ofthe golden eagles flying in the skies above, and the mule deer and sharp-tailed grouse moving on the prairiebelow.Medicine Rocks is setabout 11 miles north of Ekalaka and 30 miles west of both the North Dakota and South Dakota borders. The sitewas privately owned until Carter County, Montana seized the property inthe 1930s. Thestate of Montana took over ownership in 1957 and in 1993 it hadthe site declared a “primitive park.” Today, the parkis managed by the stateDepartment of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.	This beautiful ancient site is dotted with perforated sandstone pillars considered sacred by some Native American tribes. 	"[""O'Fallon Historical Museum"", 'White Butte', 'Makoshika State Park']"	1141 MT-7 Ekalaka, Montana United States	46.0459	-104.4571	['ericjkillelea', 'breaingram']	2017-02-16 00:00:00	['The Most Wondrous State Parks to Visit During the Government Shutdown']	['Indian Head', 'Hemer Felsenmeer', 'Chimney Rock', 'Teakettle Rock']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/medicine-rocks-state-park
