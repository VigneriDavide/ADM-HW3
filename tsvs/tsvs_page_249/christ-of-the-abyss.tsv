Christ of the Abyss	['underwater', 'water', 'statues']	597	73	While figures of the divine and the decorative abound in densely populated areas, rarely do you see honored artistry in the middle of nowhere. The Christ of the Abyss statue in San Fruttuoso, Italy, hopes to change that in some small way.The “Christ of the Abyss” is a bronze likeness of Jesus Christ made by Guido Galletti. It was placed upon the bottom of the Mediterranean Seaas an honor toDario Gonzatt, the first Italian to use scuba diving gear. It was installed17 meters under the wavesin August of 1954, where it stays to this day.Similar statues have been placed underwater and aboveground all over the world, some as an homage to the original, others as mere tangential copycats.The original clay statue from which this first sculpture was cast is now in Ravenna, Italy’s National Museum of Underwater Activities.
