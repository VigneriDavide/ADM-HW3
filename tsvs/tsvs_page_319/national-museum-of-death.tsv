National Museum of Death	['saints', 'rites-and-rituals', 'death', 'collections', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	497	43	Eerie, funny, and sometimes intense, this museum explores Mexico’s ever-present relationship with death.Located in the city of Aguascalientes, the National Museum of Death opened to the public in the summer of2007 as a permanent collection belonging tothe University of Aguascalientes, after the institution inherited hundreds of death-related artifacts amassedoverOctavio Bajonero Gil’s lifetime, including some of his own artwork.Seven years into its operation, however, the mission of the Museum wasrefined, as its collection expanded in the direction of depicting the historic role of death’siconography and thefunereal arts within Mexican culture, both contemporary and ancient. Integral in this expansion were artifacts fromthe personal collection of one Daniel Mercurio López Casillas.Throughout this process of the investigation, the Museum’scurators conveyed the widerange of Mexican society’s relationship towards death andSanta Muerte himself, ranging fromthe popular portrayal of a people who are alwaysjoking and laughing about mortality, to the nitty gritty — sometimes quite graphic — reality of death most corporeal.Paintings, sculptures, lithographs, and photos are used to illustrate points along the way, explaining the relationship of Mexico’s culture with death via images rather than words.Step by step, the Museum takes its visitors through ahistory of death, across the land now known as Mexico. Starting in the Pre-Hispanic era, the exhibits follow a timelinethrough the periods of the Spanish Conquistadors’ domination and decimation of the native civilizations, to the reassertion of Mexican independence, up to the contemporary period, including the international community’s appropriationof the sugar skull in pop culture.What results is anexperience described by a recent visitor as an “interesting surprise,” particularlyvibrant and multifaceted given what could easily have come off as gloomy, dismal subject matter.	A uniquely robust and historic look at Mexico's omnipresent dance with Death. 	['Templo de San Antonio', 'Aguascalientes Government Palace Murals', 'Castillo Ortega-Douglas']	101 Rivero y Gutiérrez Aguascalientes, 20000 Mexico	21.8841	-102.2958	['eolmosc', 'littlebrumble']	2016-10-31 00:00:00		['Museum Tot Zover', ' Roman Urn Collection at SAMA', 'The Sanctuary Museum', 'Museum of Death']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-museum-of-death
