Montana Vortex and House of Mystery	['mystery-spots-and-gravity-hills', 'mystery']	497	120	This whimsical place is fun, weird and interesting even for the most sceptical. Step into the garden and the slanted House of Mystery—see and experiment for yourself! The one-hour tour is given by one of the owners but you’ll also have time to explore the mysteries and anomalies on your own.	A classic mystery spot complete with spots that are said to make you shrink or grow when you stand on them. 	['Lake McDonald', 'Wreck of the Steamship Helena', 'Going-to-the-Sun Road']	7800 Highway 2 East Columbia Falls, Montana, 59912 United States	48.3825	-114.1221	['nakkerooz', 'kweiss2001']	2019-06-21 00:00:00		['Bayers Lake Mystery Walls', 'Moncton Magnetic Hill', 'Gravity Hill', 'Rua do Amendoim (Peanut Street)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/montana-vortex-and-house-of-mystery
