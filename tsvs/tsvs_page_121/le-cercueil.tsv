Le Cercueil (The Coffin)	['horror', 'bars', 'unique-restaurants-bars']	937	450	The gruesome ambience of this bar offers the drinker an immersive macabre lesson in hell-bent bar-hopping. Le Cercueil was unleashed onto the world in 1974 following the release of the horror movie, “The Exorcist.” The decor, featuring grim reapers and dark skeletons, creates a morbid atmosphere in this unique tavern. The only thing creepier than placing your skull-shaped beer mug on a coffin is the nomenclature of the cocktails. Sit back and sip on your choice of corpse juice, devil’s sperm, and vampire blood. The bar offers a speed-dating service but beware, the ultraviolet neon lights give potential lovers an eerie corpse-like appearance.	The Devil’s own choice when he needs a drink in Brussels. 	"['Théâtre Royal de Toone', ""Everard t'Serclaes Monument"", 'Délirium Café ']"	10 Haringstraat Brussels, 1000 Belgium	50.847	4.3532	['martin--2']	2013-07-22 00:00:00		['Elliott Street Deli & Pub', 'Velvet', 'Chowning’s Tavern', 'El Batey']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-cercueil
