Cedars of Lebanon State Park	['landscapes', 'flora', 'trees', 'parks', 'plants', 'geology']	726	211	The Nashville Basin of central Tennessee is a flat, low-lying plain of limestone—the remains of an ancient Ordovician sea riddled with sinkholes, caves, and other karstic features. The soil of the basin is often very thin and in many places it has completely eroded away, leaving a landscape of exposed, weathered stone slabs and gravel piles that resemble abandoned parking lots.Though the hot, dry conditions in these environments are harsh and almost desert-like, they are home to a unique ecosystem known as acedarglade after the tough Eastern RedCedar trees (which is actually a kind of juniper) that dominate them.Cedargladeshave a gradient of ecological zones, from bare limestone where only lichens, mosses, and cyanobacteria grow, to thinly soiled xeric lands inhabited by tough clumps of grasses and low herbaceous plants, to open savannah dominated by the titular redcedars.Cedargladesprovide habitats for many rare, endemic plants such as the Tennessee Coneflower,NashvilleGlade-Cress, Lime Stonecrop, and others. Cedargladeswere initially ignored by European settlers since they made poor farmland and thus were left fairly unaltered. In the modern age, though, urban growth and development in the Nashville area have become significant threats to these rare ecosystems. To protect and preserve theglades, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has designated many of them as state parks or natural areas.One of the largest areas of preservedgladesisCedarsof Lebanon State Park, located within the larger Cedars of Lebanon State Forest. This woodland was named by early European settlers for its supposed resemblance to the biblicalcedarforests of ancient Lebanon that were used by King Solomon to build the Temple in Jerusalem. In addition to its numerousglades, the park preserves large sections of oak-hickory forest along with many karstic limestone features such as sinkholes and several small caves. This area was also wherecedargladeswere first recognized as a distinct and rare ecosystem.	This park contains one of the largest concentrations of cedar glades, a unique and rare ecosystem. 	"['Peace Sign Geoglyph', ""Timothy Demonbreun's Cave"", 'The Nashville Clayscape']"	328 Cedar Forest Rd Lebanon, Tennessee United States	36.0859	-86.3242	['johnmeszaros']	2019-07-16 00:00:00		['Fragas do Eume', 'Chapel Rock', 'Drago Milenario', 'Pillnitz Camellia']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cedars-of-lebanon-state-park
