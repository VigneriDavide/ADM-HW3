As her epitaph indicates, she worked with compassion for the less fortunate of Savannahas a Chatham County commissioner. She was also the first woman from her city to compete in the Boston Marathon, and went on to win races in Georgia.While it’s touchingmemorial to a woman doing what she loved, the statue’s bronze skin has now oxidized to an eerie shade of green and her eyes have gained a blackened shadow, so itcan give quite the start to those unaware.	An eerie smiling woman looms above the granite tombstones. 	['Grave of Gracie Watson', 'Grave of Corinne Elliot Lawton', 'Original Taco Bell Sign']	Bonaventure Cemetery 315 Greenwich Road Savannah, Georgia United States	32.044	-81.0471	['ddmaxfield', 'rlhyzer']	2016-10-05 00:00:00		['Moriarty Monument', 'Mausoleum of José Alfredo Jiménez', 'Stone Man of Bowman Family Crypt', 'Howard Mausoleum Pyramid']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-bonaventure-jogger-savannah-georgia
