Long Lines Building	['spies', 'government', 'architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	1376	749	So you finally noticed that terrifying, windowless skyscraper in the middle of Manhattan? It’s fine, really. Now, move along.Unofficially known as the “Long Lines Building,” New York’sdoom-iest tower was designed in 1974by architect John Carl Warneke. Though its most noteworthy feature is its utterlack of windows, the building is also known for its unusuallyhigh ceilings and for being designed to bear an extremely large amount of weight per square-foot.Not that thelatter two details are something the average citizen would ever be privy to witnessing on their own, of course. The name “Long Lines” suggests a lovely hat tip to the building’s architectural elements, but in reality the sky fortress was originally created to houseAT&T’s carrier exchanges for their long distance telephone switches and equipment. Today it continues in that purpose, while also storing a portionof the company’sdatacenter processing. This ephemeralelement of the technological infrastructure has been deemed so important that the building is able to survive nuclear fallout and exist off-grid for up to two weeks without issue.What’s more, it’s since come to light that thisominous building is used as a hub for NSA spying—a brick-and-mortar arm of the surveillance state. As reported by The Intercept, the fortified skyscraper was not onlymade to safeguard criticaltelecommunications equipment, a sort of fortress for the information age, but it also housesequipment for controversial government data collection and wire tapping, codenamed TITANPOINTE.One look at the skyscraper’s face should tell you that public admittance isn’t an option. But that beautiful, terrifying image you have in your headof stories upon stories of telephone cablesand digitalboxes stacked 18-feet high, glowing within the building’s impenetrable walls, might just be better than the real thing, anyway.	An uber-secure, windowless tower of doom in the center of Manhattan is an NSA spyscraper. 	['Farm.One', 'Tunnel Number 3', 'Dream House']	33 Thomas Street New York, New York, 10007 United States	40.7164	-74.0061	['littlebrumble', 'erjeffery']	2015-09-01 00:00:00		"[""Glasgow City Chambers' Staircase"", ""England's Smallest Window"", 'Architect of the Capitol Archival Warehouse', 'Old Stone House']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/33-thomas-street
