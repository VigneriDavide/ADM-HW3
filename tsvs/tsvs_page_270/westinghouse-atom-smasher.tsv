Westinghouse Atom Smasher	['physics', 'energy', 'nuclear']	565	131	The World’s first industrial Van de Graaff Generator is lying on its side, abandoned but still intact, in Forest Hills, Pennsylvania. Built bythe Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1937, “the atom smasher was the centerpiece of the first large-scale program in nuclear physics established in industry,” according toInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It remained in use until 1958. In 2015, the bulb was taken off of its pedestal and laid on its side in hopes that someone will eventually restore it. It is a symbol of Westinghouse’s early involvement in nuclear power, but also the fleeting nature of our technological work.	This icon of the Atomic Age now lays dormant. 	['Trundle Manor: House of Oddities', 'Carrie Furnaces', 'The Living Dead Museum']	386-398 Avenue A Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15221 United States	40.4116	-79.8434	['aceofstace', 'jmswisher']	2020-05-26 00:00:00		['Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant', 'Orlando Towers', 'Camp Century (Project Iceworm)', 'Icecap Ground Zero']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/westinghouse-atom-smasher
