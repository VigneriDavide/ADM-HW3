Abandoned Dome House 	['abandoned-houses', 'retrofuturistic', 'houses', 'homes', 'abandoned', 'architecture']	578	106	An uninhabited dome housein poor condition deteriorates in the woods of North Carolina.The house shares a certain architectural aspect withFuturo Houses, a1960s architectural fad, prefabricated vacation homes that were appropriate for beaches, mountainsides, and forests. They were the invention of Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, and sold like hotcakes when they debuted in 1968. They represented a leisurely, modern vision of the future. The trend didn’t last though, and today more Futuro Houses lie abandoned than inhabited.While this particular home appears more Futuro inspired than an actual Futuro model, it has nonetheless suffered the same fate of abandonment.The dome house in the woods outside Chapel Hill is in verybad shape. The roof is caved in and severely rotted decking prevents any real access. But you can still see the strange white bubble shape along the south side ofJack Bennett Road and peek your head in through the hatch to imagine the life of Futurians.Update 2017:Sadly, this home was destroyed and removed by a developer on April 7, 2017.
