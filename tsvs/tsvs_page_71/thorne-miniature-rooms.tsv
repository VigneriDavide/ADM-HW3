Thorne Miniature Rooms	['museums-and-collections', 'art', 'museums']	1237	1496	In the depths of the Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago is a carpeted room withwindows into 68 gorgeously decorated rooms—each built to the scale of 1 inch: 1 foot.The rooms were aproject byNarcissa NidblackThorne, who marriedtheheir to a department store fortune. As a child,she’d always loved dolls and dollhouses; as an adultwhotraveled extensively through Europe, she made it a hobby to collect miniature furniture and accessories.To house hercollection, Narcissa drewdesigns for several rooms to holdher treasures, and commissioned cabinetmakers to construct them. It was 1932, and unemployed craftsmen were plentiful. Over time, though, theproject became increasinglyambitious. In 1936 she was asked to create a miniature version of the library at Windsor Castle to mark the (ill-fated) coronation of Edward VIII.Inspired tocreate more facsimiles of real rooms from some of Europe’s mostimpressive castles, museums, and homes, she hired architects andmembers of the Needlework Guild of Chicago to get the designs just right, down to the tiny textiles and carpets.The Thorne Miniature Rooms are beautiful examples of painstaking craftsmanship, and of architecture and interior decoration from specific places and periods. Visiting theThorneMiniature Rooms Exhibition allows museum-goersperiod-accurate glimpses into European and American interiors from the late 13th century all the way through the 1940s, in a way that logistics like time and spacewouldn’t otherwise allow. They were featured at exhibitions and art museums throughout the United States before finally settling at the Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago. (Three more are in the collection of the Indianapolis Children’s Museum, the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles, and the Phoenix Art Museum, and nine can be found in the Knoxville Museum of Art in Tennessee.)The collection at MAIC, though, is thought to be the largest collection of miniature rooms in the world.But, like any rooms, Thorne’s creations get dirty and require maintenance. The skilled team of Art Institute staff members tasked with cleaning the miniature rooms aren’t little elves or regular-sized humans wielding feather dusters and vacuum cleaners scaled to size. Rather, these extremely gentle humans come armed with cotton swabs and eye droppers, attacking the works with a degree ofpride and skill necessary whenmaintainingimpossibly small handmade time machines.	Each of these gorgeous, intricately decorated rooms is painstakingly crafted to the scale of 1 inch: 1 foot. 	['Pritzker Military Museum & Library', 'Chicago Stock Exchange Trading Room', 'Chicago Stock Exchange Arch']	Chicago, Illinois, 60603 United States	41.8796	-87.6237	['rachellyon', 'sararaposo']	2016-12-15 00:00:00		['French Shore Interpretation Centre', 'Museo del Barro (Museum of Clay)', 'Museo Pumapungo (Pumapungo Museum)', 'Tennessee Williams Museum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thorne-miniature-rooms
