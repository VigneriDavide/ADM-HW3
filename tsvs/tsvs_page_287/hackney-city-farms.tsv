Hackney City Farm	['farms', 'animals']	539	362	In the middle of a city lives aflourishing garden withfarm animals! Pigs, donkeys, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, and sheep roam the Hackney City Farm.It might seem strange that the Hackney City Farm is located in the heart of London, but theidea behind its establishment in 1948 was to give young people and city locals theopportunityto escape city life and experience agriculture.Since its opening, the farm has developed into anintegralcommunity resource.The farm was given a grant by the London Borough of Hackney, but the funds have steadily declined. As a grasp atindependentsustainability the farm entered the commercial market, renting workspace for other charities, selling fresh produce, and sellingsouvenirs.The farm community works hard to provide an educational and entertaining environment for visitors, and strives to teach the skills of living a healthier lifestyle with a smaller environmental impact.	A flourishing garden with pigs, donkeys, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, ducks, and sheep. 	['Extreme Bike Course in Haggerston Park', 'Former Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children', 'Columbia Road Shops and Flower Market']	1 Goldsmith's Row London, England, E2 8QA United Kingdom	51.532	-0.066	['michelleferlito', 'martin--2']	2013-07-17 00:00:00		['International Fox Museum and Hall of Fame', 'Robert Is Here', 'Café i Fårhus', 'Alpacas of Curraghduff Farms']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hackney-city-farms
