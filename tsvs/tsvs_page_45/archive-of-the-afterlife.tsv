Some say a few of these items seem tobe more “charged” than others, such as the Annie portrait, the mutilated effigy doll, and the aforementioned execution cap.The rest of the room harbors funerary and mortuary items, which includes two embalming tables, one embalming pump, and two service display caskets. One casket is for adults and the other is for infants. The funerary items are accompanied by an array of funeral home advertising and signage.
