Pet Cemetery Cenote 	['cenotes', 'pet-cemeteries', 'extinct-animals', 'underwater', 'rivers', 'caves', 'ecosystems']	544	104	The remains of dead animals, tossed into the bottom of a cave away from the light of day who-knows-how-long ago, have resurfaced in a most unexpected way.Deep in the jungle outside Tulum, Mexico, divers, conservationists, and tourism leaders have combined forces to provide public access to this totally unique section of the world’s second-longest underwater cave system. Under continual exploration since its 1987 discovery, the Dos Ojos underwater cave system extends for an estimated 51 miles, filled with crystalline, balmy freshwater accessible via 28 known sinkholes–locally called “cenotes” (say-NOH-tays).Throughout the course of these explorations, a team of divers came upona truly marvelous discovery. Itsjaw-droppingrock formations are punctuated bystalactites and stalagmites, withpockets of darkness in which blind cave fish flourish. Most staggering of all, the bottom of the pool has a soft, dune-like surfacewhich, when sifted,revealed unforeseen treasures: the pit was littered with animal bones ranging from ancient to the more familiar, including thelower jawbone of a tapir and thefossilized remains of an extinct prehistoric camel.Visitors tothis site, which was nicknamedPet Cemetery after these finds, with the proper credentials and training, can still see these skeletonsand more, in their original positions. Scientists have pieced together a theory that the sinkhole was used as a disposal pit long ago, before the water table rose and flooded the animals’ mass grave. As with all underwater caves, this location is not suited for beginning SCUBA divers, as cavern and cave diving requires specialized training. Fully guided dives are available for those who believe they have proper experience. Snorkeling, however, is an option at the site that allows visitors of all ages and abilities to enjoy the myriad speleothems in this highly decorated cenote. With respect for the fragility and unique nature of the Pet Cemetery Cenote, which is filled with delicate, low-hangingstalactites and other formations, it is requested that interested divers and snorkelers choose their participation method according to their skill level, so as to best preserve the wonder for generations to come.Above ground, on the jungle trek en route tothe cenote, living ancestors of these animals are on full parade. Spider monkeys are a common sight in the trees above, not to mention more common ground-dwelling creatures of rainforest climes, all of whom prove as equally awe-inspiring to divers above water, as their deceased brethren at rest below the waterline.
