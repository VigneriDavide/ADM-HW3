Recycled Roadrunner Statue	['recycling', 'outsider-art', 'sculptures']	431	313	This giant avian first stood at the Las Cruces Foothills Landfill to draw attention to our consumption habits, the power of recycling, and how much we toss away into landfills. The massive bird was then relocated to the rest area west of Las Cruces on I-10. The sculpture stands a whopping 20 feet tall and is composed of old shoes, cell phones, bike parts, and other recycled materials.	A 20-foot-tall roadrunner constructed of discarded items watches over the I-10.
