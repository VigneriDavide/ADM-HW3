Cornhenge	['corn', 'public', 'food', 'art']	1199	918	Corn stalks are notoriously tall but the ears themselves were never as tall as a human beinguntil the construction of the public art display in the Columbus, Ohio suburb of Dublin.Commissioned by the Dublin Arts Council and completed in 1994, Field of Corn (with Osage OrangesTrees)consists of 109 six-foot, white ears of concrete corn that sprout right from the ground just off the highway. It was designed by artist Malcolm Cochran, a professor of sculpture at the Ohio State University.Molds taken of three original sculptureswere used to cast ears which were then rotated to provide a variety of angles so each cob appears unique to the observer.Casting was done at Cooke & Ingle, Co., Dalton, Georgia, (now Metromont Corporation).Each 1,500-pound cob was shipped to Ohio in four truckloads.The installation sits on a former cornfield that was worked by farmer Sam Frantz. Frantzworked with The OhioStateUniversity on the creation ofseveral species of hybrid corn. Thesculptures werespecifically modeled to look like the Corn Belt Dent Corn varietal.While the work is meant to honor both Frantz and Ohio’s rich agricultural past, at first many locals saw the food-shaped concreteas nothing more than an ironic joke: tax dollars spent to honor food farmers ending up creating inedible food.However as time went on, the field of concrete earshas become something of a town icon. Locals have held weddings in the field, nearby office workers visit in the winter to play in the snow among the strange sculptures and most of Dublin now embracesthe installation.There is also a deeper symbolism in the corn. As artist Malcolm Cochran put it, “There is a serious side to the work as well: Mychoice of white concrete was deliberate to mimic, in a subliminal way, the rows of crosses in Arlington National Cemetery. It is ultimately amemorial to agriculture and, by extension, to a way of life and regional identity that has been replaced by corporate office complexes and housing developments. Five bronze plaques trace the history of land use at the site, from Native American time to the present.”Central-Ohioans frequently refer to the work asthe Cement Corn (or “See-ment” Corn depending on your pronunciation) and is visited by residents of Dublin and out-of-towners alike,all drawn tothat weird field of cement corn in Dublin.	The inventor of a number of hybrid corn species is immortalized with a field of giant corn. 	['Leatherlips Monument', 'Early Television Museum', 'Columbus Park of Roses']	4995 Rings Road Dublin, Ohio, 43017 United States	40.0855	-83.1228	['josh', 'rachel']	2014-01-26 00:00:00	['Favorites']	['Criollito', 'The Flavored Esquites of Bernal', 'Roppongi Hills Street Furniture', 'Corn Water Tower']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cornhenge
