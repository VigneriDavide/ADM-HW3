Itsstory begins as far back as1293, when the Archbishop of Toledo was granted a charter by King Sancho IV of Castile to found a“studium generale.” Two hundredyears later, in 1499, Pope Alexander VI granteda papal bull, whichexpanded the Complutense into a full university.Today, thebest reason to visit the University isitsMuseum of Anatomy, “Javier Puerta,” created in 1787 by royal decree ofKing Charles III, who was known for his contributions to science and research.Part of thecollege of medicine, the museumis made up of anatomical models, mummified and artificial body parts, and three sculpture collections.The wax polychrome sculpture collection displaysa series of anatomically precise wax models, representing the stages of pregnancy from conception to childbirth, the oldest of which date back to 1794.The plaster polychrome sculpture collection is essentially acollection of plaster sculptures of human body parts.The ominous-sounding bone collection is comprised of thousands of skulls, and two skeletons.One of these, which dates back to the Spanish War of Independence (1807-1814), is the skeleton of a French farmer and grenadier who, due to the mercury salts in his bones, is speculated to have beenkilled by mercury poisoning.The other is the the skeleton of the so-called Extremeño Giant, saidto have been brought to the museum alive by Pedro Gonzalez de Velasco, the museum’s directorat the time.	One of the world's oldest universities houses an incredible collection of anatomical models, mummified body parts, and human bones.  	['Reverte Coma Forensic Museum', 'Museo de América', 'Parque del Oeste Pillboxes']	Plaza de Ramón y Cajal Madrid, 28040 Spain	40.4447	-3.7241	['rachellyon', 'kostas1964ath']	2016-12-14 00:00:00	['The Ultimate Guide to Scattered Body Parts']	"['Hand of Man Museum', 'Gympie Bone Museum', 'Gordo the Barosaurus', ""'The Battle of Gotland 1361' Exhibit""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/javier-puerta-museum-of-anatomy
