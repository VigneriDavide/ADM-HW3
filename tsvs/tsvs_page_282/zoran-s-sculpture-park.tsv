Zoran's Sculpture Park	['follies-and-grottoes']	545	167	Anyone who has walked the dead end street past the Grainbelt Bottling House and taken a twirl around the parking lot to reorient themselves, have likely noticed the small, perpetually under construction sculpture park that lies beyond the railroad tracks.Artist Zoran Mojsilov, a Belgrade-born sculptor and illustrator has made the park his pet project over the years, placing his minimal yet strong stone sculpture works, held together with delicate steel rods in the off-the-beaten-path lot. Take a spin through, bring a picnic, and if you’re lucky, the charismatic eastern European artist himself may make an appearance.
