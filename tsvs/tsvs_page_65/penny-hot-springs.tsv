Penny Hot Springs	['hot-springs', 'rivers', 'water']	1293	197	Sure, you know about Glenwood Hot Springs Pool, but that’s for tourists and takes a lot of pennies. The Penny Hot Springs 30 minutes south is for those in the know, and is absolutely free.The Penny Hot Springs are located below the large granite cliffs named “Hell’s Gates.” They were named for hotelier Dan Penny, who set up a hotel and bathhouse and made good use of the springs. The cultural revolution of the 1960s brought less modesty, and visitors started to enjoy the springsau naturale.Unfortunately, locals were not pleased with this, and essentially shut the bathhouse down.About 20years ago, the county purchased the property and restored the pools. Today the natural, non-commercialized setting is peaceful and makes you feel like you’re in on asecret.The white hot spring watermixes with the frigid Crystal River and creates varied temperature pools, depending on how much river water is allowed into the rock pools.The water can bedeceptively hot—it will scald and you cannot tell if the stream running into the river is cold or hot by sight, so step over until you know for sure. 	A little-known hot spring haven right below the highway. 	"['Marble Mill Site Park', 'Maroon Bells', ""Doc Holliday's Grave""]"	14418 CO-133 Carbondale, Colorado United States	39.2318	-107.2272	['mtclymer001', 'hawk187']	2017-01-11 00:00:00		['Remington Hot Springs', 'Charco Azul', 'Koshi Barrage', 'Ureka']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/penny-hot-springs
