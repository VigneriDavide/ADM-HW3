Ægir Brewery	['giant', 'monsters', 'vikings', 'beer', 'mythology', 'bars', 'legends', 'unique-restaurants-bars']	421	125	In Norse mythology, Ægir is a sea giant, often mistaken for a god, who lives in a hall beneath the sea that is home to the souls of everyone who drowns. More importantly, the mythical creature is said to brew the best beer in the Nine Worlds. And that’s why they named this microbrewery and pub in Flåm for him.When you go to the center of Flåm, the first thing you may notice is a white, leafless tree. On closer inspection, you’ll see the tree is carved with faces of characters from Norse mythology and ravens. A path leads off from the tree to whatlooks like a large stave-church. This is the Ægir brewery.Inside the big, red double-doors is a spacious room with a bar at the back, where you can order beer, aquavit, or mead from the barkeep, who will pour the drinks from taps with antlers for levers. You can then enjoy your drink around a large fireplace at the tables and chairs made from driftwood, or onstone benches covered with sheepskin, while Nordic folk music plays in the background.	A Viking-style brewpub named for a Norse sea giant, in the heart of fjord country. 	['Flåmsbana (Flåm Railway)', 'Aurland Lookout', 'Laerdal Tunnel']	A-Feltvegn Flåm Norway	60.8639	7.1162	['guthbrand']	2018-07-04 00:00:00		"['Brauerei Hofstetten', 'The Baverstock Arms', 'Elfde Gebod', ""Papa Joe's Biersalon Klimperkasten""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aegir-brewery
