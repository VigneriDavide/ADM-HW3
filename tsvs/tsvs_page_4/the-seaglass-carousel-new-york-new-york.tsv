Constructed as a public-private project, it took 10 years and several million dollars to bring the SeaGlass Carousel to life.The SeaGlass Carousel features 30 fiberglass fish spotlighting 12 different species, while themechanics are unique in that there’s no traditional center pole. By putting individual motors for each fish below the floor, the riders have unobstructed views while the fish both spin independently and swirl around each other as though swimming through the ocean.Rides of the SeaGlass Carousel will also experience a changing LED light display that makes one feel as though they are truly underwater. To add to the overall experience, each fiberglass fish containsits own speakers that play aquatic sounds and music specifically composed for the ride.Each of the fish in the carousel is modeled after an actual species ranging from tall angelfish to the much smaller clown triggerfish. No matter which you choose, it will resemble one underwater lifeform or another that can actually be found out in the ocean	Manhattan’s Battery Park has a whimsical carousel full of spinning, glowing fish. 	"['The Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton', 'WPA Murals of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House', ""The American Merchant Mariner's Memorial""]"	State Street & Water Street (between the Battery Park Underpass and State St) New York, New York, 10004 United States	40.7022	-74.015	['rorigrable', 'dancinshoes']	2016-04-06 00:00:00		['Flying Horse Carousel', 'Pasco County Stilt Houses', 'Casa dos Bicos', 'Tattingstone Wonder']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-seaglass-carousel-new-york-new-york
