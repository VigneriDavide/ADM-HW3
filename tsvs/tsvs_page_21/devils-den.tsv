Located near Williston, Florida, it is privately owned and operated as a scubadiving training and recreational facility.The pleasant year-around air temperature of 72 degrees allows comfortable diving, winter or summer. On cold winter mornings you can see steam, like smoke, rising from the cave’s chimney—the reason that early settlers called the place Devil’s Den.	The scuba diving training facility was named for the steam that rises from the cave's chimney. 	['Cedar Lakes Woods', 'Historic Haile Homestead', 'Wood and Swink General Store and Post Office']	18844-18854 NE 51 St Williston, Florida, 32696 United States	29.4078	-82.4762	['akornblatt', 'planan']	2016-01-15 00:00:00		['Jigokudani (Hell Valley)', 'Reykjadalur', 'Ayres of Swinister', 'Cascade Falls']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devils-den
