It looks like something out of a fantasy novel: awide, sandy cavern with the blue waters of the Pacific rushing in. TheMarieta Islandsis a group ofuninhabited islandsformed by underwater volcano eruptions. They are natural wonders, but it was something other than thevolcanicactivitythat brought the burrowed beach to light.Itis rumoredthat the hole that createdthe Hidden Beach was a result of deliberate bombings. The Marieta Islands have always beencompletelyuninhabited, making them ideal sites for military testingby the Mexican government.Beginning in the early 1900s, weapons and artillery were tested on the Marieta Islands, a safe distance from Mexican citizens but not so safe for Marieta topography.Test bombs are the known cause for many caves and rock formations on the island, possibly including the Hidden Beach.In the 1960s, scientist Jacques Cousteau led a protest against harmful human activity on the islands. In 2005, the islands were finally named a national park, Parque Nacional Islas Marietas, making swimming, kayaking, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation the onlyactivity, and prohibiting hunting and fishing around the islands. Also, later on, the park was designated as a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Extensive military testing damaged flora and fauna on the island for decades, but many years of peace have replenished the islands’ pristine waters and marine life.The Hidden Beach is invisible from theoutsideand is only accessible through a long water tunnel that links the beach to the Pacific Ocean. There is approximately six feet of space above water level, sovisitors can arrive at the beach by swimming or kayaking. The islands remainuninhabitedbut are frequently visited by tourists who come to enjoy the diverse marine wildlife and the unique tropical Eden of Playa del Amor.	A lovers' beach, tucked below the surface of the island, provides a safe haven for romance. 	"['Reindeer of La Cruz', 'Cementerio de Sayulita', ""'El Buzo' ('The Diver')""]"	Islas Marietas Mexico	20.704	-105.5649	['sg495', 'martin--2']	2016-04-16 00:00:00	['10 Unique Beaches From Around the World ']	['Neskowin Ghost Forest', 'Jusanji Pond', 'Murchison Falls', 'Sea of Stars']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hidden-beach-playa-del-almor
