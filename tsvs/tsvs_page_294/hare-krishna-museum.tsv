Working as part of the larger Hare Krishna community facility in Culver City, California, the museum is meant to educate, inspire, and give visitors a better understanding of the Bhagavad-gita, the Indian literaryclassic that remains sacred to over six million people.It consists of eleven dioramas and numerous animatronics that lead visitors through the story. In each diorama, talking clay robots give their uniqueperspective on the Bhagavad-gita. The story concludes in the final diorama, which is filled with dancing, pipe playing, and melodic chanting. All in all, the entire guided tour takes about 45 minutes to walk through.The museum was established in 1973, when at the request of His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, a group of disciples traveled to India to learn about the ancient method of clayworking. When the artists returned to the United States, they put their newfound skills to use creating these dioramas.	Dioramas and animatronics lead you through the story of Bhagavad-gita, the Indian literary classic.Â 	['The Museum of Jurassic Technology', 'Center for Land Use Interpretation', 'Lawrence and Martha Joseph Residence and Apartments']	1764 Watseka Ave Culver City, California, 90232 United States	34.0251	-118.3972	['drdive', 'martin--2']	2013-01-01 00:00:00		"[""World's Largest Collection of Smallest Versions of Largest Things"", 'Oficina Museu (Workshop Museum)', 'Cuypers Library', 'The Sanctuary Museum']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hare-krishna-museum
