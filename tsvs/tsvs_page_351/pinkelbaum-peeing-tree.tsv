Pinkelbaum (Peeing Tree) 	['peeing-statues', 'trees', 'plants', 'art']	457	82	Unlike in the U.S., where it is forbidden by law, in Europe it’s not rare to see a man standing to pee at the side of the road, or even at a tree in the city. Less common but not unheard ofis awoman hovering behind bushes with her pants down. Some might wonder what the flora has to say about all that.The artist Friedrich Karl Waechter surely consideredthis when he created his piecePinkelbaum, or Peeing Tree.As part of the Frankfurt art initiative Komische Kunst (Funny Art), the artwork is installed in an old maple tree.A plaque nearthe tree reads (translated from German): “For 300 years I was pissed at, starting today I piss back.”Just walking towards it, the tree looks very innocent, but once you getcloser, there it is: the passerby is hit by a stream of “pee.” Most people, after recovering from the shock, find it quitefunny. The tree is located at the side of the way around the little lake Jacobiweiher, near the Oberschweinstiege, one of Frankfurt’s nature areas.The pee stream breaks only in winter for a short time. The Pinkelbaum is still there, but it does not pee, to prevent damage by frost.	After years of being casually peed on by humans, this tree is peeing back. 	['Frau Rauscher Fountain', 'Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge)', 'Frankfurt Wishing Wells']	65 Oberschweinstiegschneise Frankfurt Germany	50.0715	8.6816	['christine-williamson', 'theops2']	2016-11-15 00:00:00	['The 9 Greatest Peeing Statues Ever']	"['Desert Bottle Tree ', ""'In Between'"", 'Deer Horn Tree', ""'Shadows in Another Light'""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pinkelbaum-peeing-tree
