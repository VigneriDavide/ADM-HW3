The Narrows	['national-parks', 'rivers', 'water']	2749	1076	The trek through the Narrows of Zion National Park isa stunning sight: The pathcan be as skinnyas 20 feet wide, while the verticalred canyon walls shootup to 2,000 feet high on either side. It’s considered one of the best hikes in the world — butbe prepared to get verywet. Slot canyons, narrow canyons that are drastically taller than they are wide, areoften on the bucket list for intrepidhikers. However,although they are formed over time by water rushing through rock, only a few still have a river running through them.That’s what makes the Narrows so legendary.The hike through the Narrows, locatedon the North Fork of the Virgin Riverin Utah’s Zion Park,starts at the section of the canyonknown as the Temple of Sinawava, and ranges from two to sixteenmiles depending on the route.The trek will simultaneously delightyour eyes with one of the most beautiful sights imaginable and drenchyour clothes with cold water.This is because, for a third of the hike, the Virgin River fills the Zion Canyon from wall to wall, forcing hikers to slosh through the water atop slippery rocks to move forward, sometimes submerged as muchas chest deep.Adventurerslooking for a real challenge will attempt the Narrows in the spring, when the snowmelt makes for even higher water levels, although if the flow rate reaches 120 cubic feet per second the river is closed off to tourists. Hiking through a slot canyon is not without itsrisk. Despite the dry climate of the American Southwest, the number one danger is the canyon filling with too much water. During a rain storm, the water level can rise quickly in such a narrow space. Tragically, 11 tourists drowned in Utah’s Antelope Canyon in 1997 when the water level rose in thetight, inescapable pit. Despite the risk, thousands of adventurers wade through the Narrows every day.After two hours of hiking through the river, trekkers will reach “Wall Street,” a deep, dramatic canyon — appropriately named, considering its wealth of good views.	The hike through a narrow river flanked by the 2,000-foot-tall walls of Zion Canyon is one of the best in the world. 	['Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel', 'Checkerboard Mesa', 'Grafton Ghost Town']	Temple of Sinawava Zion National Park Springdale, Utah, 84767 United States	37.2867	-112.9477	['moviesbylew', 'profnewman']	2016-06-08 00:00:00	"[""The Ultimate Guide to America's National Parks""]"	['Isa Lake', 'Glenaladale Weir', 'Charco Azul', 'Koshi Barrage']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/narrows
