Kishi Station	['novelty-architecture', 'cats', 'trains', 'transportation', 'animals']	463	31	Kishi Station inKinokawa, Japan, was threatening closure due tolow ridership in 2004. Then a lucky calico cat came along to save the rural station on theKishigawa Line of the Wakayama Electric Railway from obscurity.Tama, a stray calico cat, was adopted in 2007 as Kishi Station’s Super Station Master. The feline who sports a station master hat at a rakish angle has gone on to draw tens of thousands of visitors a year, keeping the train station in business for locals and reviving what was once a depressed point of the Wakayama Prefecture into a tourist boon.In 2010, the station was renovated to be cat-shaped, and inside there’s a cat-themed café. There’s evena Tama-themedtrain that departs the station. In 2015, Tama passed away, and was replaced by her apprentice Nitama, also a calico. As of this writing Nitama was still on the job, taking photographs with fans and sleeping soundly at her post. She can be visited in her office.	A calico cat named Tama was the wildly popular Super Station Master at this train stop in southeast Japan. 	['Awashima Jinja ', 'Okunoin Cemetery', 'PL Peace Tower']	Kinokawa, 640-0413 Japan	34.2094	135.3121	['allison', 'dmajorgizmo']	2014-08-25 00:00:00		['Kindergarten Wolfartsweier', 'Nevada Northern Railway Museum', 'Fish Car No. 3', 'East Broad Top Railroad']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kishi-station
