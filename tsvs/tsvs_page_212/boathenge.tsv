BoatHenge	['lewis-and-clark', 'stonehenge', 'boats', 'ships', 'roadside-attractions', 'outsider-art']	664	171	At first glance, BoatHenge seems like nothing more than a bunch of boatsstuck oddly into dry land; but, like most of America’s great art installationscreated in a similar vein, it is only upon ruminating on the collective work itselfthat its true radiance begins to appear.Initiallyseenfollowingthe hundred years’ flood of 1993,this series of painted boats in a lawn adjacent to the Katy Trail along the Missouri River isthe work of anonymous artists. According to theofficial website, the circle of marooned crafts’ origin story states that BoatHengeeither “sprouted from the earth or fell from the sky on the first day of spring.” Built of the very things best suitedto withstand waves, successive ravages of floods that have appeared since its arrival have done nothing to fell BoatHenge, instead only adding to its impressiveness.Upon successfullyrelinquishing theobfuscatedorigins of BoatHengeto the realms of the unknowable, the site’s nitty-gritty detailsreveal that the installationconsistsof six fiberglass boats burstingvertically fromthe ground and arranged in a semi-lunarformation. Precise mathematical measurements showthat their height, width, and depth planted into the earth average to(gasp!) exactly match that of the original, ancient and mysterious Stonehenge located atWiltshire, England.Adding a more American twist to the mystery are a series of apocryphal, tongue-in-cheek ties to famed explorers Lewis and Clark.	Like Stonehenge, but with boats and oodles more charm.  	"[""Devil's Icebox"", 'McBaine Bur Oak', 'Thomas Jefferson’s Original Tombstone']"	11301 South Smith Hatchery Road Columbia, Missouri United States	38.845	-92.3876	['tracys', 'diego2']	2015-11-10 00:00:00	['There Are a Lot of Quirky Henges Around the United States']	"['SS Shieldhall', 'The Sarah Mead', ""'Conny The Whale'"", 'Albaola Itsas Kultur Faktoria']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boathenge
