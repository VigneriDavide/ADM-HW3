Church Rock	['geological-oddities', 'geology', 'sacred-spaces']	569	497	Very near toNewspaper Rock State Historic Monumentand the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park, this oddly shaped sandstone formation was erroneously associated withMarie Ogden’s nearby utopian community “Home of the Truth”.The rectilinear opening at the base of the formation was not, however, an attempt to hollow out the rock to make it into a church as local lore would have it (hence, Church Rock), but was in fact dynamited and cut out of the stone by the property owner during the 1940s to store salt licks and feed for cattle.	Oddly shaped rock formation, misassociated with a nearby utopian community. 	"['Home of Truth', 'Newspaper Rock', 'Hole n"" the Rock']"	Monticello, Utah, 84535 United States	38.074	-109.3452	['zackofalltrades', 'breaingram']	2013-07-07 00:00:00		['Am Phu Cave', 'Govan Stones', 'Mount Osore', 'Katskhi Pillar']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/church-rock
