That Wanaka Tree	['lakes', 'trees', 'water', 'plants']	896	447	Framed by the South Island’s stunning Southern Alps, a lonely tree has grown up to spread its wings just off shoreat the south end of Lake Wānaka.Known as the “lone tree of Lake Wānaka,” it is said to be one of the most photographed trees in all New Zealand. However, you still need to have theinside scoop to find it, as there are no signs directing people to the solitary tree. It’s just enough off of the beaten path to not be bothered by too many tourists unless they’ve done their research.Walking along the lake to find the lone tree is a beautiful sight. When you arrive, you’ll find beach access on the shore just a stone’s throw away from the tree, the perfect place to have a picnic and watch the sun set or rise. If you can stand the cold butrefreshing water of Lake Wānaka, swimming is a great way to awaken thesenses. The lone tree is right at the foothills of Mount Aspiring National Park, a World Heritage Site, acting asa doorway into even more of the breathtaking landscapes that embodythe South Island of New Zealand.Try visiting when the sun is low on the horizon and there’s an abundance of colorful low light, rather than the view beingbleached out by the midday sun. At thistime of day you’re also more likely to find the lone tree of Lake Wānaka, all alone.	A solitary tree has grown up all alone on Lake Wānaka, backdropped by the beautiful Southern Alps. 	['Puzzling World', 'Cardrona Bra Fence', 'Arrowtown Chinese Settlement']	Glendhu Bay Wanaka, 9305 New Zealand	-44.6988	169.1181	['blindcolour', 'jongrantham']	2016-09-23 00:00:00		['Sukko Cypress Lake', 'Chapel Rock', 'Bonsai Rock, Lake Tahoe', 'Fairy Lake Bonsai Tree']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lone-tree-of-lake-wanaka
