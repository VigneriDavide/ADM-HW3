Palau Dalmases	['curio-cabinets', 'palaces', 'medieval', 'history', 'architecture']	894	379	Palau Dalmases is among themost beautiful 17th centurypalaces in Barcelona,situated on the historic Calle Montcada. This street, world famous for the Picasso Museum, was once the heart of the city’s most prestigious district, wherewealthy families and ennobled merchants chose to buildtheir Gothic residences.The facade ofthe building dates back to the 14th century, but the palace’s Baroque architectural gems are from after it was remodeled by awealthy merchant and nobleman Pau Ignasi Dalmases, who lived therebetween1690 and 1705.During this time thepalace wasthe meeting place ofthe Academy of Desconfiats (Academy of the Distrustful), a scholarly society created by a group of aristocrats in Barcelona in 1700 to study language, culture, history, literature, and philosophy. Its members, known as “Els savis del Born” (“The Wise Born”) enjoyedexquisite meetingsaround the palace’s cabinet of curiosities and musical instruments.Today, the historic Palau de Dalmases operates as a flamenco performance venue, but has retained some of its original treasures, such as the Baroque courtyard and the salomic columns on the staircase, on which you’ll find a frieze depictingthe mythological story of Neptune’s chariot. Itis one of the few civil historic landmarks ofthis artistic style remaining in Catalonia, asmost of themonumental heritage from the era has been lost to the destruction of wars and the steadymarch of time.	This former Baroque palace on the historic Calle Montcada is a rare architectural gem and was once the meeting place of an aristocratic scholarly society.  	['FC Barcelona Coat of Arms', 'European Museum of Modern Art', 'Chocolate Museum']	20 Carrer de Montcada Barcelona Spain	41.3845	2.1814	['felipetrigo', 'rink']	2017-01-04 00:00:00		['West Gate Tower Museum ', 'Alcázar de Segovia', 'Muchelney Abbey', 'Bač Fortress']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palau-dalmases
