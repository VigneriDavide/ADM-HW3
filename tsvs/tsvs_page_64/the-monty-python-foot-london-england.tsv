The Monty Python Foot	['comedy', 'television', 'paintings', 'museums']	1301	454	Hanging in Room 8of London’s National Galleryis another painting of Cupid and Venus, made for yet another King of France.The painting is Bronzino’s Mannerist masterpieceAn Allegory with Venus and Cupid,made in the 1500s for King Francis I.The piece hangs large alongside works byMichelangelo and Raphael,depicting with great detail and texture Cupid kissing his mother Venus.Hundreds of years after Bronzino createdhis allegorical painting,a young animator working on a British television show wandered the museums of London looking for inspiration and imagery to use for his work. The animator was the gifted Terry Gilliam and the show was the epic comedy series Monty Python’s Flying Circus.If you look carefully at the bottom lefthand corner of the painting, you may notice that Cupid’s foot is the emblematic Monty Python foot—you know, the giant foot that randomly stamps down from the heavens obliterating objects beneath it.You may recognize the foot from theFlying Circus’s animated titlesequence: At the end of the opening, the giant foot descendsand crushes the title. The foot became atrademark icon forthe Monty Python comedy troupe.It was here in the National Gallery that Gilliam saw the wonderful, huge Bronzino painting and borrowed Cupid’s foot for TV. Indeed, this is somethingGilliam did quite frequently.Monty Python’s Flying Circuswas written and performed by five Englishmen while Gilliam, the lone American living abroad, was the sole creator of the show’s surrealand wonderful animation (although he occasionally pops up in sketches, too). His collage-like animations combined borrowedbits and pieces of famous paintings and photography.Decontextualizing the images and juxtaposing them with other absurditiesworked perfectly with the show’s humor and doubled as a commentary on classical art. Ittransformed many of the classicimages into, well, something completely different—cultural icons in their own right.	The television series' iconic giant foot was borrowed from this classical painting. 	"[""'The Ambassadors'"", 'Trafalgar Square Imperial Measurements', 'The Fourth Plinth']"	National Gallery Trafalgar Square London, England, WC2H United Kingdom	51.5089	-0.1283	['filmplante', 'julius-spada']	2016-06-13 00:00:00	['Favorites']	['The Laurel and Hardy Museum', 'Texas Broadcast Museum', 'National Comedy Hall of Fame & Museum', 'Ralph Foster Museum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-monty-python-foot-london-england
