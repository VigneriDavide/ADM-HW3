Skyspace: The Color Inside	['installations', 'color', 'observatories', 'art']	1064	264	Artist James Turrell’s light and space installations can be found across the globe. His “Skyspaces” incorporate changing colors and shadows, and offer alternative framesfor viewing the sky.Turrell began creating his Skyspaces in the 1970s, and as of 2013, he’d created 83 of them, in places including Arizona, Japan, Ireland, London, the Netherlands, California,Las Vegas.Now, you can add the rooftop of the student union at the University of Texas to the list.Called “Sky Space: The Color Inside,” The UT installation seats up to 27 people in a dome-like structure which has an oculus open to the elements. Inside the room are hidden lights which project a sequence of colors on the curved white ceiling in such a way that makes it appear that the sky itself is changing hues. It’s interesting, meditative and trippy all at the same time.Turrell considers the art only viewable at sunrise and sunset. Unfortunately, the Student Activity Center isn’t often open at sunrise, but the room remains available for quiet contemplation throughout the day.
