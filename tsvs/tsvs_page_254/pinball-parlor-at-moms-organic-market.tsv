Behind a partition on the left wall of the market, a paradise of silver balls, chirps, chimes, flippers, and blinking lights awaits you.The offerings in this most unlikely of amusement parlors range from the latest greatest hi-tech machine to vintage games from the 1970s and ’80s. All of them cost about 50 cents, and all of them are extremely fun. There’s something special about pinball that makes it more fun than most regular old video games. It takes skill, and it’s tangible; you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you do well in the game.A change machine in the room provides unlimited quarters for you to enjoy the games from Nash’s collection. A sign on the wall gives you a quick rundown of the rules and etiquette of pinball, one ofthe most unique arcade games imaginable.
