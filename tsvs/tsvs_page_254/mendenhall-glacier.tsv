Mendenhall Glacier	['ice-caves', 'glaciers', 'wildlife-sanctuaries', 'ice', 'waterfalls', 'forests', 'lakes', 'ecosystems', 'water']	589	717	Mendenhall Glacier, not far from downtown Juneau, is is one of the few Alaskan glaciers with an “EZ-pass”: It’s surrounded by the Tongass National Forest, but you can easily get there by car, by air, by foot, and even by cruise ship.This 13-mile ribbon of ice flows from the Juneau Ice Field, a 1,500-square-mile frozen plateau that feeds 38 major glaciers.Leftover from the last ice age, the ice fieldand its solid river offspring have been in a period of retreat, and the wilderness surrounding Mendenhall has found itself in a good news/bad news scenario.The bad news is the ice, which has been steadily receding since the time of the Little Ice Age (a global cooling period between the 16th and 19th centuries) continues to shrink as the planet continues to warm.The good news is that the expansion of Mendenhall Lake – which was born in the early 1930s from the melting ice – as well as concentrated conservation efforts, have resulted in a stronger, more resilient ecosystem for the forest and its native fish and wildlife populations, such asmountain goats, bears, beavers.Mendenhall is located on land owned by the federal Forest Service, whichprovides facilities, park rangers, a visitor center, and year-round exhibits and educational outreach.The trails from the visitor center – some lazy and looping, others more challenging – will get you up-close and personal with the glacier and its waterfall neighbor, Nugget Falls, raining down just next door.	A rare chance to get up close and personal with a 13-mile ribbon of ice near downtown Juneau. 	['Mendenhall Ice Caves', 'Brotherhood Bridge Fireweed Field', 'The Upside-Down Forest of Glacier Gardens']	Glacier Spur Road Tongass National Forest Juneau, Alaska United States	58.4337	-134.5539	['tdlehrman', 'bljohnson']	2016-08-15 00:00:00	['12 Natural Wonders You Can Visit Via Public Transportation']	['Lake Abraham', 'Broke Leg Falls', 'Yumbilla Falls', 'Narusawa Hyoketsu (Ice Cave)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mendenhall-glacier
