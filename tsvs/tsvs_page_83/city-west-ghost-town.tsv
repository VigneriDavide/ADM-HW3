City West Ghost Town	['ghost-towns', 'history']	1151	281	Though Chicago grew up to becomeAmerica’sthird biggestcity, 30years before the Civil War it wasn’t much of a place. In the early-1800s,Chicago still only had about 200 residents. Hounded by disease and hardship, it almost joined the long list of American ghost towns. Andin 1837, an ill-fated towncalled City Westtried toknock the Windy Cityout of the running.City Westsprouted up about 60miles across the lake from Chicago in what became Indiana Dunes State Park. Apart froma tiny frontier French outpost, before the 1830s there were few whites living in the Indiana Dunes. When Michigan City, Indiana, popped up as a railroad town and lumber port, rival investors started their own town a few miles down the beach.But City West turned out to be a “dream city,” mostlydoodles on a map, thougha few buildings did see the light of day.A (mostly imaginary) plat map shows plans forabig town, time and place considered. One settler built a sawmill to turn out boards for houses.Gardens sprouted upin the sandy soil.Indians came down the lake in canoes to see the activity. About 20American families showed up, maybe 200 peopletotal. One man built a 22-room hotel and tavern,probablythe biggest building between Chicago and Detroit.Timothy Ball, an 11-year-old settler from Massachusetts, later rememberedCity West’sshortlifespan.The town had no church or school, so kidsspent their time harvesting berries in the dunes andwatching sails on the lake. Afew settlersdied there that summer, but shifting sand dunes gobbled the cemetery up.ThenAmericanbanks and businesses began tocollapse. Soon, City West’s promoters abandoned it and the place becamea ghost town.Yet some families stayed in the area and children found a great adventure spot in the ruins. In a fascinating prelude to the housing bust of the early 2000s, which left suburban real estate developments empty, pioneer kids explored brand-new homesleft open to nature, including the 22-room hotel. “The houses were there but the place was solitude,” Timothy Ballwrote.Somehouses were swallowed by sand dunes, but most were taken apart and carted away for lumber. Around 1853, “on a night of wild thunderstorms,” Ball recalled, the last traces ofCity Westburned down in a forest fire, sparked either by lightningor debris from a passing train. The Windy City itself burned down in 1871, but by that time Chicago, unlike City West, was important enough to rebuild.	"The site of a 19th century ""dream city"" that almost rivaled Chicago before being swallowed by the Indiana sand dunes. "	['Mysterious Sinkholes of Mt.
