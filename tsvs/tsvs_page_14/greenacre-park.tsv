Greenacre Park	['pocket-parks', 'gardens', 'parks', 'natural-wonders', 'plants', 'nature']	2454	734	At only 1/7 acre, this is one of the smallest hidden parks in the city, but it provides a nice lush place to relax and take a break from the urban landscape.The crowning feature of the pocket park is the 25-foot waterfall, which is not only stunning, but also roars away the city noise so you’re left in a calming oasis. The park was constructed in 1971 by the Greenacre Foundation after a design by Hideo Sasaki, but it feels fresh even decades later where the honey locust trees and rare Midtown calm lure people to linger in its shade.
