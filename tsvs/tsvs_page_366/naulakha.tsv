Naulakha	['eccentric-homes', 'literature', 'homes']	441	94	Famed author Rudyard Kipling built Naulakha in the late 1800’s to create a place of peace that echoed both his past in India and his future in the America’s.Styled after the Mughal architecture Kipling became fond of during his time in Lahore, the 10-acre Vermont estate was created to be a place of luxury and relaxation. Kipling named the house after theNaulakha Pavilion, an ancient structure in the famous Lahore Fort, the name itself translating to “9,000 rupees,” the price of the original building’s construction. The home was outfitted with sunken gardens, a pool, and a full tennis court, a first in Vermont history.While staying in the house Kipling would write many of his most famous works including the Jungle Books, Captain Courageous, and some of the Just So Stories.  TheNaulakha estate is now preserved as a national landmark, and even opens its doors to visitors who would like to stay overnight in the house that inspired Mowgli and Baloo.	The house where Rudyard Kipling wrote the Jungle Book is also the location of the first tennis court in Vermont. 	"['Dummerston Vine', 'Retreat Tower', ""Madame Sherri's Castle""]"	481 Kipling Road Dummerston, Vermont, 05301 United States	42.8981	-72.5645	['butson', 'specs1624']	2012-11-05 00:00:00		['Curwood Castle', 'Castle Frankenstein', 'Edward Bellamy House', 'Abbotsford House']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/naulakha
