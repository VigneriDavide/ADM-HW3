Site of the First Train Robbery in the West	['crime', 'crime-and-punishment', 'trains']	483	210	Travelers between Des Moines and Omaha whoprefer to avoid Interstate 80 will find themselves traveling along a quieter, more historic stretch of road. Unbeknownst to modern travelers, this part of Old US Highway6 was once the sight of a type of heistheretofore unheard of in the American West.Telling the story of this history-altering event is a modestmarker justover a milewest of Adair, Iowa, located off County Road G30. Here, an upright train car wheel marks the spotwhere, on the duskysummer evening of July 21, 1873, Jesse James and his gang executed the world’s first robbery from aboard a moving train.Led to believe $75,000 of gold was aboard a certain set of cars running this stretch of rails belonging to theChicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, the James gang devised a plan to stop the train by dismantling itstrack.Much tothe dismay of the James gang, a delayed shipment of gold meant a paltry$2,000 was foundin the train’s safe, rather than the handsome reward the outlawshad believed lay in wait. In order to compensate for thisunexpected loss, the gang made off with anadditional $1,000 worth of personal property from the train’s passengers. The wheelcommemorating this fateful turning pointin American thievery was donatedby the Rock Island Railroad in 1954. Standing nearly as tall as an adult man, the monument illustrates the dangers faced when robbing a train in motion, throwing into heightened relief the boldness of the feat pulled off by Jesse James and his gang.	Lured here by the promise of tens of thousands in gold, Jesse James started a quintessentially American trend of robbing trains in-motion. 	['Albert The Bull', 'The Danish Windmill', 'Bonnie and Clyde Dexter Shootout Marker']	1156 Anita-Adair Road Adair, Iowa, 50002 United States	41.4833	-94.6757	['rubezahl', 'littlebrumble']	2016-05-05 00:00:00		['Bridego Bridge', 'Napier Prison', 'Queensland Police Museum', 'The Hanging Stanes']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-of-the-first-train-robbery-in-the-west
