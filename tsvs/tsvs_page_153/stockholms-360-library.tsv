Stadsbiblioteket (Stockholm Public Library)	['towers', 'libraries', 'books', 'architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	815	427	The Stadsbiblioteket, the main branch of the Stockholm Public Library System, isone of the most distinctive buildings in the Swedish capital. The 360-degree tower of books at the top is a bibliophile’s temple to reading in-the-round.The graceful rotunda is open to the public, who canclimb to the top of thestacks and peer down on the collections below.The library is an example of Nordic Classicism, pioneered by Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s. The slightly chilly façade is, at the same time, oddly inviting, as if to say “we are here to work, but all are welcome.” This stylewas sometimes known as “Swedish Grace,” a simplified and accessible classicism that had great influence on everything from furniture design to sculpture.Beyond its unique architectural design, the Stadsbiblioteket contains over 2 million volumes and more than 2.4 million audio tapes, and was one of the first libraries to allow direct access to the stacks without the help of a retrieving librarian. It also hosts the International Library, housed intwo stories of an annex behind the main building. The collection catalogs books in more than100 languages, with more than 50,000 titles available to loan.As of September 2022: The library is currently being renovated.	The library's graceful rotunda is like a bibliophile's temple. 	['Hey STHLM', ' Stockholm Meteorological Station ', 'Stockholm Observatory']	73 Sveavägen Stockholm Sweden	59.3434	18.0548	['lyneeberger', 'gruddpers']	2017-03-13 00:00:00		['Yangzhou Zhongshuge', 'Riggs Library', 'Millicent Library', 'Anclote Key Lighthouse']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholms-360-library
