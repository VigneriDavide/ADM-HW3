Maggie Wall's Memorial	['witches', 'witchcraft', 'mystery', 'memorials', 'monuments']	817	112	Outside of a small village of Dunning, nestledin the former parklands of Duncrub Castle, lies a monument. It’s acollection of stones about 20feet high, topped with across and decorated with gifts left by visitors—pennies, feathers, shells, fluffy stuffed animals, and tiny tea candles. The stones bear the words in stark white lettering: “Maggie Wall burnt here 1657 as a witch.” Scotland was home to nearly 3,800 people accused of witchcraft between 1500s and 1700s, the vast majority of whomwere women. In the end, about 1,500 were murdered as a result of witch hunt inquisitions.However, mysteriously, there is no record ofa woman named Maggie Wall being tried as a witch. What’s more,there’sno record of the monument itself until 1866,though aforest surrounding the monument called Maggie Walls Wood was documented as of 1829.Some claim that Maggie Walldid exist, her records simply didn’t. Somelocals theorize that a member of the Rollos, a powerful family that lived in Duncrub Castle, had an affair with Maggie Walland built the monument out of guilt.Another theory is that Maggie was a part of a backlash against a group of officials trying to elect a new local minister. The group was attackedby a horde of women, and some believe Maggie could have been singled out and punished. The accepted theory is that this monument stands as a testament to all the witches murdered in Scotland during the witch hunts as no other such monument exists. Perhaps the name was taken from the surrounding wood to represent the countless and forgotten women who were killed. Occasionally a wreath is laid at the foot of the monument, serving as a reminder of the injustices suffered by the mysterious symbolic witch, Maggie Wall.	A mysterious monument where a woman who records say never existed was burnt alive for being a witch.  	"['Library of Innerpeffray', 'North Inch', ""'Towser'""]"	Dunning, Scotland, PH2 0QS United Kingdom	56.3088	-3.6081	['hcw2rp', 'jaszmina']	2017-04-11 00:00:00		['Memorial to Alse Young and Lydia Gilbert', 'William Donaghy Memorial', 'Anna Göldi Museum', 'Paisley Witches Memorial']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/monument-for-a-witch-called-maggie-wall
