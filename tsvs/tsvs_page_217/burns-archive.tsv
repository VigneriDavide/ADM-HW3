The Burns Archive	['medical-museums', 'medicine', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	653	69	Dr. Stanley Burns lives in a museum of his own making.The walls of the ophthalmologist’sbrownstone homeare covered in incredible photographs depicting anatomical oddities, medical procedures, historic events, social movements. There are drawers full of daguerrotypes and closets crammed with photos in boxes labeled “Skulls,” and “Crime Scenes.” And that’sa mere fraction of his collection. TheBurns Archive, which incorporates images from the mid-19th century through the 1950s, numbers over a million photographs.The archiveis a uniquely comprehensive visual documentation of how the world, particularly the field of medicine, has changed since photography was first introduced. Many of the photos in Dr. Burns’ collection, which he has been amassing since 1975,depict dark or disquieting aspects of life. Victorian post-mortem photography is well represented, as are blood-soaked crime scenes, the violent struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, and the horrors of war, both civil and international.The most strikingpart of the archive is the collection of medical photographs. From the 19th-century images of med students smiling beside a half-dissected human corpse to the sepia-toned photographs ofbodies distorted by genetic abnormalities, skin conditions, and tumors, the collection offers a fascinating look at how we haveapproached medical care over the decades.Dr. Burns and the archive’sCreative and Operations Director, Elizabeth Burns, haveproduced several books of photographs from the collection, on topics as diverse as news art, podiatry, bereavement, injured Civil War soldiers, and “Stiffs, Skulls, and Skeletons.” Photographs from the collection regularly appear on the walls of major galleries and museums. TheBurnses also serveasMedical, Historical, and Technical Consultants on theHBO series The Knick, which depicts turn-of-the-century surgical procedures with stomach-churning accuracy.	A staggering collection of photographs depicting medical, social, and historical change. 	['The American Kennel Club Museum of the Dog', 'The New York New Church', 'The Daily News Building Globe']	140 E 38th Street New York, New York, 10016 United States	40.7485	-73.9776	['ella-morton', 'molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2015-10-09 00:00:00	['Even Midtown Manhattan Has Its Secrets']	['Museo de Anatomopatología (Museum of Pathological Anatomy)', 'Greatbatch Barn', 'Medical Museion', 'Musée Eudore Dubeau']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burns-archive
