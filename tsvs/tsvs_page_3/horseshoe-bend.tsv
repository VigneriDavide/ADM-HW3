Horseshoe Bend	['geological-oddities', 'water', 'geology']	4034	1822	Just a short hike from Route 89 near Page, Arizona is one of America’s great natural wonders. In a spectacularly dramatic landscape, the area provides great hiking among the red rocks looking over the river.Swirling around a 1,000-foot-high pedestal, the Colorado River bends in a smooth circle around a massive, craggy rock formation before flowing back through the Southwest. Although the landscape is wonderfully natural, visitors should tread with caution. There are no rails keeping you from falling down the steep, rocky cliffs.	Dramatic river bend surrounds a natural red-rocked pedestal. 	"['Street of the Little Motels', ""Lee's Ferry and Lonely Dell"", 'Antelope Canyon']"	US-89 Page, Arizona, 86040 United States	36.8781	-111.5116	['facebook590576781', 'agmpietrow']	2011-12-08 00:00:00		['Yuncheng Salt Lake', 'Pertosa Caves', 'Waw an Namus', 'Lake Posta Fibreno']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/horseshoe-bend
