Brooksbrae Brick Factory	['factories', 'graffiti', 'abandoned']	572	172	In its heyday, theBrooksbrae Brick Company had the ability to produce thousands of bricks a day, however, many doubt the factory ever reached operational status. The owner of the factory,William J. Kelly, died in 1908 before the factory was up to full speed. Due to complications within his will, all of Kelly’s assets were frozen, halting all of the facilities’ operations.In 1915, railroad workers from the Central Railroad of New Jersey went on strike near Brooksbrae. To avoid any damages to the factory, a caretaker was assigned to watch over the property. One winter night, the elderly caretaker and his wife lit a fire in the stove to warm up the residence. However, they didn’t check or clean the chimney’s flue causing a massive fire, killing the couple.After the issues with Kelley’s will were resolved, the factory was sold. Due to the deaths on the property the factory was left incomplete. The area is now a popular graffiti and art spot.	Hidden deep within New Jersey Pine Barrens is a massive graffiti wonderland. 	['Popcorn Park Zoo', 'Apple Pie Hill Fire Tower', 'Cathedral of the Air']	Pasadena Woodmanse Rd Manchester Township, New Jersey, 08759 United States	39.8899	-74.4415	['lynattirb', '78769da2-c88c-4fef-9657-19e790ae61b9']	2019-10-30 00:00:00	['25 Places Reborn Through Graffiti and Street Art']	['Zakłady Włókien Chemicznych ', 'Cotton Belt Freight Depot', 'Wasa Graffitilandia', 'La Siberia']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/brooksbrae-brick-factory
