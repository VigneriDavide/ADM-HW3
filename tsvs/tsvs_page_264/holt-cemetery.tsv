Holt Cemetery	['potters-field', 'graveyards', 'cemeteries']	573	272	In a city that can often feel like one giant necropolis, New Orleans’Holt Cemetery sets itself apart in that 99 percent of its dead are buried below ground. Some erroneously state that burials are above ground because of a high water table. The above ground burials are from New Orleans French and Spanish cultural influences.For years the land had been informally designated asa site for potter’s graves before Dr. Joseph Holt officiallyestablished the cemetery in 1879. Primarily belonging to African-Americans, the plots are free minus the cost of digging and are kept by the family as they are well maintained.Grave markers are handmade. ranging from everyday items like PVC pipes and garden fences, to painted fence posts and astro turf, toplastic headstones adorned with adhesive lettering. Mouldering teddy bears and plastic flowers are common. At the cemetery’s center grows a massive oak tree, wherecowrie shells, beads, beer, and other less traditional spiritual offeringscan be found among the tree’s rootsand branches.Located within spitting distance of the sprawling and ostentatious Metairie Cemetery, the differencebetween the two is evident at first glance. In the vastly contrastinggulf betweenthese two cities of the deadlies Holt’sunique and powerfulability to showcase thatpart of New Orleans so often omittedby the itsfamous cemetery tours.One of the oft looked for graves is Buddy Bolden (1877-1931), a musician who was critical of the development of jazz music. He was buried in an unmarked grave, but a headstone was erected in 1988 in his honor.	A haunting, yet lovingly hand-hewn potters' field full of graves that flood with each heavy rain. 	['The New Orleans Train Garden', 'Moriarty Monument', 'Rice Family Mausoleum']	635 City Park Avenue New Orleans, Louisiana, 70119 United States	29.9852	-90.1064	['spindle', 'littlebrumble']	2015-07-15 00:00:00		"[""The Hangman's Elm"", 'Milltown Cemetery', 'Yanakie Station Cemetery', 'The Menster Christmas Cookie Gravestone']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holt-cemetery
