There is much to explore, but the highlight is thevery large doublefireplaces that obviouslywarmed multiple floors of the former structure. There is also what appears to be a wood or coal furnace and what looks like a water boiler.While it looks like the original structurewas built and remodeled in different decades—there are remnants of stone, concrete and cinder blocks—it’s possible that it was all builtat the same time as all these materials were available during the 1920s and 30s.Some locals believe the ruins wasoriginally aspeakeasy from the Prohibition era.Whatever it was, it’s suspected thatthe buildingmet its demise in the mid-1950s, either by alarge fire or possiblya flood.One of the local legends isthat there was a bottomless lake in the area and anyonewho swam in it sank and went to Hell—hence the name “Devil’s Hole.” The lake issaid to have disappeared after the largeflood that hit the area in 1955.You can seemore exploration of the ruins in this video.Update July 2018: The road to the parking lot is closed and not accessible to many vehicles.
