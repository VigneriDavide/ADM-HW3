Park Güell	['art-nouveau', 'unesco', 'gardens', 'parks', 'plants', 'architecture']	1707	4002	At Park Güell, stone, tile, plants, and Mediterranean skies magically come to life on a mountainside perch designed by Barcelona’s resident architectural genius, continuing todelight adults and children alike.Builtbetween 1900 and 1914 as part of Gaudí’s naturalist phase, the projectwas initiallydesignedas part ofCount Eusebi Güell’s private city, who envisioned the plot as a self-containedresidence with private homes for 60 families. Only later was the failed housing development reimagined as a municipal park, which opened to the public in 1924.Nestled among Carmel Hill’s north face, the main terrace of the park offers sweeping panoramic vistas of the city below – including many ofGaudí’s otherfamous creations peppering the landscape – featuringa scalloped perimeterand a giant bench built to resemble a sea serpent.At the main gate, a giant salamander known as “el drac” or “the dragon” greets visitors upon their approach to the terrace, as they wend their way through a network of Doric columns, some palm-like, that supportapillowy roof inlaid with mosaics. Colonnaded footpaths lead to manicured gardens and trick arboretums, as gracefully curving viaducts and roadways soar overhead.Gaudí’s former home, too, now converted into a museum, is easily distinguished by its Pepto-Bismol pink exterior rising four stories tall fromthe gardengrounds.Despite embodying a purpose entirely separate from its initialconceptualization, Park Güell remainsso transcendent in its current form that it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984, ensuring that the public will continue to find respite in thisfantasy world for centuries to come.	Gaudí's famously flamboyant architectural style is on full display in this sprawling park and garden. 	['Bunkers of Carmel', 'Casa Vicens', 'Tramvia Blau']	s/n Carrer d'Olot Barcelona, 08024 Spain	41.4136	2.1528	['leiris', 'elizbsmith']	2016-02-04 00:00:00		['Pillnitz Camellia', 'Villa Doria Pamphili Park', 'Pasha Gardens ', ' Al-Andalus Garden']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/park-guell
