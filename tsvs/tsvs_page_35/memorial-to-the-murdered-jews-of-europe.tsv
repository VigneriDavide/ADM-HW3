Bypairing aesthetic minimalism and a massive scope, the memorial generates an incredibly powerful tension for its visitors.Altogether 2,711 unmarked grey concrete “stelae” or slabs cover acity blocksituatedjust south of theBrandenberg Gate. Each and every one of the stelae is identical in dimension ( 7’ 10” by 3’ 1”) and eerily reminiscent of coffins, though theyvary from eight inches to over 15 feet in height. As a whole, they create a labyrinth where visitors are easilylost, contributing to a pervasive feeling of bewilderment while walking amidstthe memorial’s network of open-air corridors.Since its debut, bothpraise and criticism have been directed at the memorial. Critics of the work at oncefind fault in its commemoration of a singledemographic victimizedby the Nazisrather than the multitude of those affected including large numbers of Europe’sRoma and homosexual populations. Still, others find the vagueness of the monument’s title disturbing, in that it avoids any assignation of blame for who, exactly, took these individual human lives.Meanwhile, architectural scholarspraise its stylistic execution. AsNicolai Ouroussoff noted, Berlin’s monumentavoids sentimentality in the face of an internationallyaffectingevent, instead, “showing how abstraction can be the most powerful tool for conveying the complexities of human emotion.” All scholarly debateaside, finding a visitor who emerges unmovedby the visual impact of the installation seems unlikely.	Thousands of coffin-like pillars make up this controversial Holocaust memorial. 	['Führerbunker Parking Lot', 'Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism', 'Denkzeichen Georg Elser']	Cora-Berliner-Straße 1 Berlin, 10117 Germany	52.5139	13.3789	['ahvenas', 'littlebrumble']	2016-04-12 00:00:00		['Ghetto Wall Memorial', 'The Wiener Holocaust Library', 'Peoria Holocaust Memorial', 'Stumbling Stones of Rome']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/memorial-to-the-murdered-jews-of-europe
