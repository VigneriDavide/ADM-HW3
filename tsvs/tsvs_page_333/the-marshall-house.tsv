The Marshall House	['civil-war-b4d7af7e-da10-4f31-9752-e3ea8ca7664e', 'haunted', 'hotels']	478	417	In the oldest city in Georgia, you are bound to hear a surplus of ghost stories. In Savannah, it seems every location has a unique set of ghost stories. The Marshall House is home to quite a few.This haunted history comes from the hotel’s time as a Civil War hospital. Between 1864-1865 Union troops wounded during the conflict were treated at the hotel. There have been reports throughout the decades of hearing/seeing ghosts in the hallways, sounds of doorknobs rattling, faucets with a mind of their own, and so many more ghostly tales. A visit to this former hospital may illicit a few disembodied voices or chilling touch from a former Union soldier.	An early-19th-century hotel with a past that steeped in the Civil War. 	['Jen Library Bee', 'Lucas Theatre', 'Colonial Park Cemetery']	123 E Broughton St Savannah, Georgia, 31401 United States	32.0783	-81.0904	['taylsliotta', 'collector-of-experiences']	2019-08-20 00:00:00		['Black Monarch Hotel ', 'The Aztec Hotel', 'Providence Biltmore', 'The Mermaid Inn']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-marshall-house
