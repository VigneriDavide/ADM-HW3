This tinyislandis a rocky crater formation off the coast of Sao Miguel. Its main attraction is thecircular lagoon on the islet, whichis broken up by a tiny channel that connects it with the ocean.The result is a clear and calm pool that is perfect for swimming and diving.The islet and this natural pool are accessible only during the summer and their stunning geography has made them a popular destination. Erosion through continuous exposure to wind and water have created different rock formations around the islet,including a fascinating column-like structure.Over the years, the islet has helped whalers spot their targets and has also served as a military fort. In 1983, theunique location was declared a nature reserve to protect the endemic vegetation around the crater, as well as the crustaceans and birds who have made the islettheir home.	A perfectly circular lake is formed by the crater of an ancient underwater volcano.  	['Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Vitórias', 'Gorreana Tea Plantation', 'Violet Volcanic Tea']	Rua Luis Medeiros Rezendes Paiva Vila Franca Do Campo Portugal	37.7054	-25.4438	['josh', 'jaszmina']	2017-04-28 00:00:00	['20 Superb, Secluded, Sometimes Secret Swimming Holes']	['Painted Dunes ', 'Laguna Quilotoa', 'Glenwood Hot Springs Pool', 'Prästens Badkar (The Priests Bathtub)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/islet-of-vila-franca-do-campo
