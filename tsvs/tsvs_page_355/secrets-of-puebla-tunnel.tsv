Secrets of Puebla Tunnels	['sewers', 'secret', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'hidden', 'subterranean-sites']	453	49	In the alley of Cinco de Mayo Road, there’s a doorway leading underground that looks to be an entrance to asubway. But in Puebla, there are no subways. It is, in fact, the tiny entrance to a recently discovered secret of the city, a tunnel system used to connecta fort with the baroque city of Puebla.The underground tunnel system dates back to1531, but wasn’t unearthedand opened to the publicuntil2016. It had been covered for decades, and the archeologist who unearthed the tunnel discovered antiques in the mud. Today it operatesas a museumthat doubles as a citywide thoroughfare.Many Mexican cities have legends about secret tunnels lying just beneath the streets, used during the revolution either by royalty or even during the inquisition. Grandparents would tellthesefolk stories to children.The discovery of the Puebla tunnel lends some credence to the folklore.The tunnel—tall enoughthat a personcould comfortably ride through on horseback—originates in the historic center of Puebla and lets out to the Loreto fort, where the Cinco de Mayobattle against the French army occurred. Archeologists firstdiscerned that it was a complex sewer system,but another discovery led them to believe that people also used the tunnels for secret travel. Along with toys, marbles, and antique kitchen goods, a lot of guns, bullets, and gunpowder were found trapped in the mud. Theweaponry was mostly from the mid-19th century, around the time of the Battle of Puebla conflict between Mexico and France. Investigators believe thesetunnels may have beenused by soldiers during the war of Mexican liberation, though they also could have been used by clergy or even common folk.The tour across the tunnel includes a guided visit by archaeologists who worked on the project and displays where one can see the items that lay in the mud for so long. The tunnel museum is known as “Secrets of Puebla,” an apt name for the mysterioustunnels that lay hiddenbeneath the city for so long.	A 500-year-old series of tunnels long believed to be folkloric was uncovered beneath the streets of Puebla. 	['Rosary Chapel', 'La Casa del que Mató al Animal ', 'La Pasita']	2602A Calle 2 Nte Puebla Mexico	19.0529	-98.1915	['mario-yair-ts', 'jcarmine13']	2017-01-16 00:00:00		"['Guardian Telephone Exchange Tunnels', 'The Hidden Art Deco Tunnel Underneath the New Yorker Hotel', ""'Catacombs' of Petrovaradin Fortress"", 'Café Papeneiland']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/secrets-of-puebla-tunnel
