Pesuta Shipwreck	['shipwrecks', 'beaches', 'forests', 'ecosystems']	560	41	The Haida Gwaii archipelago is a dreamy placetucked away inBritish Columbia’s North Coast. Here, in a landdotted with temperate rainforest, secluded villages, and an ancient air, a ship washed ashore on aremote beach a long time ago.Today, the Pesuta Shipwreck Trail leads hikers ten kilometers through the forest of Naikon Provincial Park to a remote stretch of beach near the Tlell River, where the264-foot log barge ran aground during a winter storm in 1928. Like many vessels during the steam boom, the Pesuta began her life as a steam ship before being converted to a log barge in the early 1900s.During a particularly wickedtempest, the Pesuta finally came to rest along this long stretch of pebbly sand, known locally for a proliferation ofagates. The ship’sbow remains intact, listing hard to port,after nearly a century of erosion fromthe punishing North Pacific’s wind and waves. The showing portion of the ship is mainly rotting timbers, but there are also still some metal portholes and such rusting away in their original spots on the ship. What has survivedis a stunning wreck that ranks among the most approachable and explorable on Earth (despite a bit of a hike to get there), whilecontributing a sense of human scale to a landscape that can, at times, feel so ethereally removed from the rest of the world.	The stunning remnants of this wreck emerge from an otherworldly backdrop of rainforests. 	"['Totems of Haida Gwaii', ""Kiidk'yaas, the Golden Spruce"", 'Spirit Bears of the Great Bear Rainforest']"	2087 Beitush Rd Tlell, British Columbia, V0T 1Y0 Canada	53.6209	-131.929	['littlebrumble', 'magnumpi']	2016-02-10 00:00:00	['18 Shipwrecks You Can See Without Getting Your Feet Wet']	['Trollskogen (The Troll Forest)', 'Neskowin Ghost Forest', 'Les Sables du Cul du Chien', 'Forest of Borth ']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pesuta-shipwreck
