Umschreibung	['germany', 'stairs', 'sculptures']	1029	220	Hidden within an office building in Munich, a staircase seemingly leads you up… to nowhere.“Umschreibung” is in fact not a staircase at all, but an ominous sculpture by Danish artistOlafur Eliasson.The sculpture, which is made of steel and is over 30 feet tall, is a staircase in the shape of a double helix. The bottom of the steps has a small opening, so you can actually climb the stairs yourself.“Umschreibung” is a German word which means “euphemism,” or “circumlocution” and the Umschreibung web site states that the title translates to “‘circumscription’ or ‘periphrasis’ – a movement without destination, a space defined by motion rather than walls.”It’s not easy to know exactly whatDanish artist Olafur Eliasson had in mind when he created his towering sculpture in 2004.The sculpture is located in the middle of the courtyard of the KPMG building; in the midst of all that high-powered ambition and drive, perhaps it stands as a reminder that no matter how hard wework, we might all be going nowhere. Orperhaps the idea is more charitable than that. Life isn’t a destination but rather a continuous movement.	A stairway to heaven, or to nowhere at all. 	"[""'Sweet Brown Snail'"", 'Lady Bavaria', 'Filmtheater Sendlinger Tor']"	29 Ganghoferstraße Munich, 80339 Germany	48.1328	11.5403	['ahvenas', 'collector-of-experiences']	2016-05-12 00:00:00	['When Stairs and Slides Are Hiding in Plain Sight']	"['Wolfsbrunnen', ""Woodward's Spiral Staircase to Nowhere"", ""The 'Hand with Watch' Sculpture"", 'Caballero No. 1']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/umschreibung
