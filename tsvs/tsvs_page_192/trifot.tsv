Trifot	['david-cerny', 'spies', 'machines', 'photography', 'statues', 'art']	711	172	“Trifot” is a kinetic sculpture by Czech installation artist David Černý, who is known for his whimsical, provocative works like the babies crawling up Žižkov Towerand a bus doing push ups. This sculpture, installed outside the Czech Photo Centre gallery, offers a decidedly dark perspective on surveillance and privacy.The 40-foot-tall statue is modeled on vintage cameras with eyeballs in place of lenses. The bulging eyes swivel about independently, watching passersby, who might be shocked to find themselves broadcast onto one of six monitors in the area.Černý’s sculpture references the dystopian future of unchecked government surveillance in George Orwell’s1984and the terrifyingalien technology inH.G. Wells’The War of the Worlds. According to the artist though, it’s also meant to honor the observational art of photography. Those who find themselves unwittingly filmed by Trifot might feel differently however.	An Orwellian sculpture with eyeball cameras watches passersby. 	['Brown-Nosers', 'Strahov Monastery ', 'Museum of Miniatures']	Na Zlatě 1 Prague Czechia	50.0507	14.3494	['sebastian-wortys', 'molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2017-02-17 00:00:00		['Brown-Nosers', 'Hostina Obrů (Feast of Giants)', 'Man Hanging Out', 'Proudy']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/trifot
