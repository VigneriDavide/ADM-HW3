Arion Press and M & H Type	['printing', 'vintage', 'factories', 'books', 'design']	696	84	It might seem impossible that the precise lines of an entire book could be done by hand, but the Mackenzie & Harris Type foundry, established in 1915, finds that the old-fashioned method needs no perfecting.The M & H Type foundry continues to make fonts the old-fashioned way, by mouldingthem out of red hot metal. Located in San Francisco’s beautiful Presidio, the foundry shares a roof with one of the most vintage typesetters, Arion Press, and you can get a tour of the printing process from start to finish.Founded in 1974, Arion made its name publishing Beat-era books and classics printed in period-authentic type. Today, itpublishes three to four new books each year, in limited editions, using letterpress for its distinct aesthetic and custom illustrations—all with limitedcomputerinvolvement. A gallery in the lobby showcases some of the recent and older books and prints. A public tour is evenmore interesting: Visitors arewalked through the typesettingarea where you can seevintage presses, rollers, and letters being strungtogether to formwords, and then whole pages.Further along, toursdescend to the basement to see the alchemical process of actually making the individual letters out of the foundry. The tourends where the bookmaking process does, when the paper is inspected and the volumes are bound.	Fonts are born and bred here at the oldest letterpress type foundry in the United States. 	['United States Marine Hospital Cemetery', 'Internet Archive Headquarters', 'Battery Chamberlin']	1802 Hays Street San Francisco, California United States	37.7883	-122.4736	['marcin-wichary', 'brendaginty']	2017-03-02 00:00:00		['Museu Nacional da Imprensa (National Press Museum)', 'Maishima Incineration Plant', 'National Workshop For Handmade Paper', 'Cary Graphic Arts Collection']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arion-press-and-mh-type
