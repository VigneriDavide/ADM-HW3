The Museum of Interesting Things	['inventors', 'machines', 'inventions', 'objects-of-intrigue', 'collections', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	2825	225	Where can a person see a butter churn, an 1,800-year-old metal fire starter, and a 1901 cylinder phonograph all in one place? Anywhere, because the Museum of Interesting Things is built to travel.Headquartered in Manhattan’sEast Village, themuseum is the brainchild of Denny Daniel, a freelance filmmaker and photograph restorer who wanted to use his vast collection of fascinating antique devices to inspire curiosity and innovation.He started with small demonstrations in his apartment, and as people showed more and more interest, the project grew and beganto travel. The exhibit is organized by categories, like Math, Science, and Literature, which he takes to schools—elementary through university—as well as hospitals, libraries, and galleries. Any space that is big enough for him to set up a few tables for his antiques is fit for the exhibit. Visitors are encouraged to handle some of the items, to experience what it was like to use them, and makesuggestions. (That’s how the collectionended up with three 8-track players.)The idea is to remind people of today that something like the iPhonedid not come from nowhere, but evolved over time from history’s innovations. This point is probably driven home when visitors bring out their smartphonesto take pictures of his wind-up wooden box telephone.More recently, theexhibit has grown to include several“green power” items, including a crystal radio, which was powered by nothing more than radio waves.	A hands-on traveling collection of the innovative devices of yesteryear. 	"['The Forgotten Entrance to Clinton Hall', 'The Brown Building', ""Merchant's House Museum""]"	60 East 8th Street 12P New York, New York United States	40.7306	-73.993	['dennydanielx', 'molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2017-05-19 00:00:00		['Asa Jackson’s Perpetual Motion Machine', 'Musée de la Ganterie (Museum of Glove-Making)', 'American Museum of Cutlery', 'The Royal Armoury']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-museum-of-interesting-things-new-york-new-york
