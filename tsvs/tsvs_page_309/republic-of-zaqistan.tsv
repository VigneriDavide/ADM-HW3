Republic of Zaqistan	['micro-nations', 'outsider-art']	510	63	In 2005, New York resident Zaq Landsberg acquiredtwo acres of hostileland in Utah’sEvaporated Basin of the Great Salt Lake from eBay, sight unseen.Though it sounds like something one might do in the midst ofa night of heavy drinking – akin to purchasing that Japanese knife set from late-nite TV — Landsberg knew full well what he was doing. Fora grand total of $610, the 30-year-oldhad successfully acquired the keys to his own personal country, which he continues to operate over a decade later as a self-described “art project” whose goal is to “become a real country.”Since its founding, the Republic of Zaquistan hasgarnered national attention simply for existing; no permanent residents call the land home, though Landsberg and acadre of Zaquistanis who’ve petitioned for citizenship from Zaqistan’sDepartment of State make pilgrimages there once or twice a year. Features of the almost-countryinclude zero permanent shelters or roads connecting the interior, one unmanned immigration booth, a newly-erected monument to the10th year of Zaqistani Independence, onebed of plastic wildflowers, and a tinynatural rock formationdeemedMt. Insurmountable.Despiteissuing a Declaration of Sucession, and beginning to issue passports, onetechnicality stands in the way ofthe Landsberg’s creationreceiving official micro-nation designation: no other sovereign nation has recognized Zaqistsan as extant. A recent wave of international media attention directed at Zaqistan may remedy this soonerthan even its founder had foreseen.	A proto micro-nation sometimes populated by artists, surrounded on all sides by a Utah most barren. 	"[""'Eddgar and Benn'"", 'Terrace Cemetery ', 'Sun Tunnels']"	Red Dome Rd Wendover, Utah, 84083 United States	41.44	-113.4272	['littlebrumble', 'mikeinsanfrancisco']	2016-01-20 00:00:00	['30 Mega-Awesome Micro-Nations']	['Nimis in Ladonia', 'William Kent Charitable Foundation', 'Meow Wolf Convergence Station', 'The Writers Chair']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/republic-of-zaqistan
