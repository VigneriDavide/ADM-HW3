Convento de Cristo	['secret-society', 'renaissance', 'catholic', 'christianity', 'castles', 'medieval', 'architecture']	606	284	A magnificent castle overlooks the river Nabão.It is known as a convent, but it wasbuilt in 1160 as a headquartersfor the Knights Templar, the formidableCatholic military that answered to the Pope.When sovereigns feared the Pope had too much power, they annihilated the Knights Templar. In France, many were burned at the stake. In Portugal however, King Denis I took pity, and instead renamed the knights the Order of Christ. This new order would answer to the King, but was later demilitarized and converted to an entirely religious order.The subsequent heads of the Order added on to the castle in the centuries to follow. Additions included cloisters, connecting corridors, an aqueduct, and an expanded chapel, not to mention decadent ironworks, paintings, and tapestries. All of these were built in the various prevailing styles of the day, from Romanesque to Gothic to Renaissance. The greatest architectural draw is the Manueline chapel, an ornate architectural style found only in Portugal.Today, the Convento de Cristo is preserved as a museum. Ithas been a World Heritage site since 1983. The striking architecture, beautiful gardens, and unparalleled view offered by the hilltop castle don’t disappoint.	The medieval castle built as headquarters for the Pope's secretive Knights Templar. 	['Museu dos Fosforos', 'Pegadas de Dinossáurios da Serra de Aire Natural Monument', 'Aldeia Artística (Artistic Village)']	6 Estr. do Convento Tomar Portugal	39.6038	-8.4209	['pvilla', 'naumatorrr']	2017-02-07 00:00:00		['Catholic Church of Agios Georgios', 'Castilnovo Castle', 'Castle Lug', 'Rocca Sforzesca']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/convento-de-cristo
