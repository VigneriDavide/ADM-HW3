Toronto's Half House	['spite-house', 'fires', 'architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	803	368	No, this isn’t a trick of Photoshop. Nor is it the world’s nastiest spite house; rather, thisbonafide half-home shares more with itsnail housebrethren after witnessingahistory ofblightand zoning changes.The lone row home at 54 1/2 Saint Patrick Street datesback to Toronto’s slums in the late 19th century. Built somewhere between 1890 and 1893, thisbay-and-gable relic from a bygone era once was a one of six identical, structurallyintertwinedhomes on what was then known as Dummer Street.Time passed, the street names changed, and a particularly sharky land holdings company began buying up property throughout the neighborhood in the middle of the 20th century. Eventually,the owners of the row houses caved, but not as a unit. Each half of the row houses’ wholesweretorn down at an excruciatingly slow pace… until 54 1/2 remained the only one left.This begs thequestion: how does half a buildingcleave away so cleanly only toleave the rest of it standing?Very carefully. In a miraculous feat performed withclumsy andpowerfulmachinery, ademolition crew managed to teardown 54 1/2’s neighbor to the north with such precision as to not disturb any of the original facade on the building that was to remain. The white, exterior wall had once been a load-bearing wall hidden internally to divide the neighbors’bedrooms and living rooms fromeach other. One slip with an excavator and the half-housewould have come tumbling down.As of 2013, the house was reported to be privately owned and vacant. As it begins to show signs of wear, its status aslast bastion of the neighborhood’s less pleasant days are beginning toshow on its craggy, half-face. Then again,if any house has earned its character, it’s this one.	Willy Wonka would love this weird half-a-home. 	"['Toronto Neighbourhood Watch Signs ', 'Winter Garden Theatre', ""Simcoe Park 'Worker's Monument'""]"	54 Saint Patrick Street Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1V1 Canada	43.6519	-79.3892	['kergin', 'tmulrooney']	2016-08-05 00:00:00		['Montlake Spite House', 'Hollensbury Spite House', 'The Grudge (Al Ba’sa)', 'Alameda Spite House']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/toronto-s-half-house
