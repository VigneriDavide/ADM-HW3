Weighing in at 27 tons of bronze and standing 37 feet high, the statue itself towers as the tallest atop any building in the world. The metal portion of the tower boasts four giant clocks on each side, each 26 feet in diameter.Today, well overa centuryafter it was constructed, the City Hall still stands proud as the 16th tallest building in Pennsylvania and a reminderof the city’suniquely important place in American history.	This elaborate towering structure was once famed for its revolutionary height. 	['Masonic Temple of Philadelphia', 'Wanamaker Grand Court Organ', 'Wanamaker Building']	1401 John F.
