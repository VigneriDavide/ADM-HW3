In Brownsville, Tennessee an old blacks-onlyschoolhouse has been restored and turned into a museum honoring the legacy of its student-turned-superstar,Anna Mae Bullock, better known asTina Turner.The one-room Flagg Grove School was one of the first schools for African Americansin the South, built in the 1880s. It was originally located in the small town of Nutbush, where Turnergrew up (you may rememberher song “Nutbush City Limits”?) andattended grade school in the rustic building in the 1940s.Located in the old schoolhouse, the Tina Turner museum includes a collection of photographs of the beloved diva, her outlandish dresses and costumes including outfits from some of her most famous performances, old yearbooks, and gold and platinum records.The schoolhouse remainedin use up until the 1960s, after which it stood as an old barn until 2012 when it was restored and moved toits currentlocation off Interstate 40. The museum was opened with the help and guidance of Turner, as well as donations from her fans. It is part of theWest Tennessee Delta Heritage Center,which also includes the childhood home of bluesmusicianSleepy John Estes, located next door, and exhibits dedicated to the area’s heritage and musical history, namely the blues.Though theschoolhouse and its museum are small, they’re well worth the stop off the highway.The people at the centerare very welcoming andthere are frequent musical events worth checking out.	A restored, one-room African-American schoolhouse in the diva's hometown now preserves the legacy of its most famous student. 	"[""Billy Tripp's Mindfield"", 'Casey Jones Village', 'Pinson Mounds State Archeological Park']"	121 Sunny Hill Cove Brownsville, Tennessee United States	35.5406	-89.2461	['stephenfenwick', 'donnataylortoffeecat']	2017-01-31 00:00:00	['35 Places to Celebrate Black Musicians and How They Changed the World']	['Handel & Hendrix in London', 'West Virginia State Farm Museum', 'Estey Organ Museum', 'The Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tina-turner-museum
