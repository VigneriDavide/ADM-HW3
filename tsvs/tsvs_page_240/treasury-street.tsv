Treasury Street	['world-s-smallest', 'treasure', 'pirates', 'money', 'crime', 'roads']	610	1219	Measuring under seven feet wide,St. Augustine’s Treasury Street may be the narrowest street in the United States. And the lane is skinny by design.Treasury Street connects Bay Street on thewaterfront with what used to betheRoyal Spanish Treasury. Local legend says thestreet was built just wide enoughfor two men to carry a chest of gold to and fromships docked on the bay, but not wide enough space for a horse-drawn carriage to squeeze through and ride off with the money. In the former Spanish port, piracy was a serious concern, especially in the walk between the bank and the bay.	St. Augustine's record-setting narrow street was designed to protect against pirates. 	['Micro Masterpieces Art Gallery', 'Andrew Young Crossing', 'Monson Steps']	Treasury St St. Augustine, Florida United States	29.8936	-81.3129	['j-ginsberg', 'molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2017-04-10 00:00:00		['Lawrence Brook Carvings', 'Bridego Bridge', 'Whydah Pirate Museum', 'Parliament Street']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/treasury-street
