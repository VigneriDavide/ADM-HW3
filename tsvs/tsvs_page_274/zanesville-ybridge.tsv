Zanesville Y-Bridge 	['amelia-earhart', 'engineering', 'bridges']	558	479	When crossing the Y-Bridge of Zanesville, Ohio, it’s best to believeyour GPS when it instructs you to take a left in the middle of a river.Located at the confluence of the Licking and Muskingum Rivers, downtown Zanesville has long sought a solution to its watery woes. Since 1814, engineers have determined that a unique, y-shaped bridge construction was the answer. So remarkableis the designthat pioneering aviatrix Amelia Earhart even remarked that itmade Zanesville”the most recognizable city in the country.”The bridge that stands today is the fifth to feature such a literally unparalleled design.In 1979, a team of consultants reported that the fourth y-bridge was too damaged to be saved, and “that it is deteriorating rapidly and becoming a serious hazard.” Stalwart as ever, Zanesville stuck to what it knew best, and builtthe fifth y-bridge up to spec, replete with an intersection in the middle of the water, wheretraffic from U.S. Route 40 (Main Street and West Main Street) meets Linden Avenue. Regardless of the construction, one delightful fact has remained true since the early 19th century: Zanesville’s charmingly strange bridge stands among justa few bridges in the world thatcan be crossed without changing sides of the river.	A favorite of Amelia Earhart, ranking among those rare bridges that can be crossed without changing sides of the river. 	['Lock #10 on the Muskingum River', 'Old Perry County Courthouse ', 'Big Muskie Bucket']	Zanesville, Ohio, 43701 United States	39.9404	-82.0143	['solarconstant', 'mom0ja']	2016-02-08 00:00:00		['Laigh Milton Viaduct', 'Cirkelbroen (The Circle Bridge)', 'Hatsudai Bridge', 'Goz Abu Goma Bridge']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zanesville-ybridge
