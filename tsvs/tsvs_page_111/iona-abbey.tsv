Iona Abbey	['macbeth', 'scotland', 'shakespeare', 'burial-places', 'literature', 'islands']	982	340	The story of the real-life Macbeth bears little resemblance to the murderous tale portrayed in Shakespeare’s play. The real Macbeth was King of Scots from 1040, when he killed the ruling king for the throne, until 1057, when he himself was killed. According to ancient reports, the king was buried on the tiny island of Iona off the western coast of Scotland, alongside many other medieval monarchs laid to rest at Iona Abbey.Iona Abbey, now a church, isoneof the oldest and most important religious centers of western Europe, considered a sacred site.Established by Saint Columba in 563 AD, itquickly became one of the centers thatperpetuated the spread of Christianity through Scotland. Indeed, King Macbeth (“Mac Bethad mac Findlaích” in Gaelic) was knownfor helping tospread the Christian faiththroughout Europe.Today, more than a thousand years later, abbey is one of the most well-preserved Ecclesiastical buildings survivedfrom the MiddleAges on the Scottish Isles. Itsancient burial ground, St. Orin’s Chapel Cemetery (“Rèilig Odhrain” in Gaelic), is the final resting place of centuries ofmonarchs from Scotland, Norway, Ireland, France, and even some Vikings.A plaque at the chapelreads: “Built in the 1100’s, it is the oldest intactstructure on Iona. Go through the decorated doorwayto see the remains of an impressive tomb and a collectionof elaborately-carved West Highland grave slabs.”Unfortunately, there is no way to know for surewhich royal graves are present at Iona.A 1549 inventory recorded48 Scottish, 8 Norwegian and 4 Irish kings buried at St. Orin’s cemetery, Macbeth, who was nicknamed the “Red King,” among them. However, none of thosegraves are now identifiable, asthe inscriptions have worn off long ago.By the time Shakespeare wrote Macbethsometime in the early 1600s, the story of the Scottish kingwas morelegend than history. But even thoughthe real Macbeth may not have had as tragic a life as his namesake character in Shakespeare’s play, his apparent resting place certainly holds haunting beauty and majesty of epic proportions.	A small island abbey is the final resting place of many medieval Scottish monarchs, including the real Macbeth. 	"[""Fingal's Cave"", 'Clach Na Criche (The Wishing Stone) ', ""'The Unsoiling of Rockall'""]"	2 Sandbank Argyll and Bute, Scotland United Kingdom	56.3351	-6.3918	['rayodiorne', 'jaszmina']	2016-06-07 00:00:00	"[""History Tour: Shakespeare's World of Mysteries ""]"	['Robert Louis Stevenson Museum', 'Île Sainte-Marguerite', 'Licosa Island', 'Isola del Garda']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/iona-abbey
