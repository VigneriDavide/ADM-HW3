Wind Telephone	['disaster-areas', 'disasters', 'death']	738	33	When Itaru Sasaki lost his cousin in 2010, hedecided to build a glass-paneled phone booth in his hilltop garden with a disconnected rotary phone inside forcommunicating withhis lost relative, to help him deal with his grief.Only a year later, Japan faced the horrors of atriple disaster: an earthquake followed by a tsunami, whichcaused a nuclear meltdown. Sasaki’s coastal hometown of Otsuchi was hit with30-foot waves. Ten percent of the town died in the flood.Sasaki opened his kaze no denwaor “wind phone” to the now huge numberof people in the community mourning the loss of loved ones. Eventually word spread and others experiencing griefmade the pilgrimage from around the country. It is believed that 10,000 visitors journeyed to this hilltop outside Otsuchi within three years of the disaster.The phone is, of course, meant as a one-way communication. Visitors dial in their relative’s number and catch them up on their current life or express the feelings necessary to move on. Somefind comfort in the hope that their relative might hear them. As the residents of Otsuchi faced the slow progress of rebuilding theircity, thislittle phone booth helps toalsoslowly rebuild their own lives too.	"A disconnected rotary phone for ""calling"" lost loved ones offered a unique way of dealing with grief in disaster-stricken Japan. "	['Miracle Pine', 'Ryūsendō Cave', 'Kori no Suizokukan']	Otsuchi, 028-1101 Japan	39.386	141.9315	['hcw2rp', 'mrcarl']	2017-04-11 00:00:00	['Favorites']	"['Texas City Memorial', 'San Michele Arcangelo Hypogeum', 'Lakeview Gusher', ""'Monument of the Third Angel'""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wind-telephone
