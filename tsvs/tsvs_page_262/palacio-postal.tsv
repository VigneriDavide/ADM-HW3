Palacio Postal	['stamp-collection', 'stamps', 'postal', 'architecture']	577	430	The architecture of thisjaw-dropping, century-old post office nestled in the center of Mexico City’s bustling historic central district would be glorious enough on its own; Palacio Postal’s true magnificence, however, hails from the fact that its splendor iscompletely de rigueur for the masses who continue using it for purely pragmatic reasons daily, numbed to theunparalleled blend of golden architecture on all sides.Dreamt upby then-President Porfirio Díaz, the Central Historic District’s secret treasure was brought to lifebyMexican engineer Gonzalo Garita y Frontera, designedin conjunction with renowned Italian architect Adamo Boari, the latter of whomwould go on to earn international recognition for his work on the adjacentPalacio de Bellas Artes.Palacio Postal–interchangeablyreferred to as Correo Mayor, or theMain Post Office– had itsfirst stone placed on September 14th, 1902, thoughthe buildingultimately took five years to complete. Despite regular earthquakes (including a major one in 1985 which caused damage requiring no small amount of restoration to the historic building), Palacio Postal has been in continuous operation since its opening day in 1907. Designed to include an exterior façade of yellow quarry stone and ornamental columns that are decorative but not extraordinary, no one would expectthe blinding, latticed gold-work waiting just inside its doors.The structure’s unique style hasn’t lent itself to easy classification over the past century; rather, it’s become a sort of architectural mood ring, with assessments revealing more about the viewer’s perspectivethan what is necessarily most prominent in the building itself. Terms and descriptors for the Palaciomost frequently tossed about include: Art Nouveau, Moorish, Venetian Gothic Revival, Baroque, Neoclassical, Spanish Renaissance Revival, and more. What remains undeniable arethe blinding amounts of gold everywhere, its domed ceiling of leaded glass, tiled marble floors, and staircases that deliver patrons to their destinations with a grace that has been all but lost to the ages.Though investing such effort to build a literal palace in place of a simple post office may seem remiss in ourmodern era, at the time, Palacio Postal served as theflagship of Mexico’s brand new national postal system. Never before had the country been united in a single agency – let alone in a service provided by the government – with a way forits citizens toreliably communicatefrom one disparate end of the nation to the other.In addition to continuing to provide all the basic, expected functions of a post office on its first floor, Palacio Postal also houses asmall museum dedicated to displaying thehistory of Mexico’s mailservice. Its crown jewel is the invaluable, very first stamp Mexico ever issued, which truephilatelists find among the most titillating postal relics on display anywhere in the world today.	Gilded heaven for philatelists and architecture freaks, still in full working order despite sitting atop tremulous ground. 	['La Casa de los Azulejos', 'Benjamín Carrión Statue', 'Museo del Calzado (Footwear Museum)']	1 Calle de Tacuba Mexico City, 06000 Mexico	19.4356	-99.1402	['esmetravels', 'littlebrumble']	2015-10-26 00:00:00		['St. Petersburg Post Office', 'Museo de Filatelia de Oaxaca', 'Saigon Central Post Office', 'Tintagel Post Office']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-postal
