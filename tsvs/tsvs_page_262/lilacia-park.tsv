Lilacia Park	['community-gardens', 'flowers', 'gardens', 'parks', 'plants']	576	179	Imagine a place where trees overflow with flowers, and breezes carry with them a sweet, delicate scent. Such a place exists on Chicago’s outskirts in Lombard, Illinois — and it all started with two lilacs.The 1-acre Lilacia Park, named after the Latin term for “lilac,” is home tomyriadvarieties of the flower, which spread its horticultural roots from Asia Minor to Vienna to France to, ultimately, Lombard, Illinois. Lilacia Parkwasdesigned by one of America’s most famous landscape artists, andstarted with only two flower cuttings.The park’s collection of flowers originally belonged to Colonel William Plum and his wife Helen Maria Williams Plum. ColonelPlum moved to the Chicago area in 1869 and settled in Lombard when it was still a new village.The Plums purchased land and filled it with lilacs, which they fell in love with after traveling to the celebrated gardens of Victor Lemoine in France.The couple returned from the trip with two lilac cuttings, one ofSyringa vulgaris,“Mme Casimir Périer,” a double white, and the other ofSyringa vulgaris,“Michel Buchner,” a double purple — the initial cultivars of the collection that stands today.When Helen passed away in 1924, Colonel Plum lost interest in his estate and the collection of flowers he once adored. When he offered it for sale, he was told that the collection was a beloved part of the village and that it should remain intact. He passed in 1927, and in his will, dictated that the land was to be given to the people of Lombard as a public park and the house on the estate as a public library in memory of his wife.The acclaimedlandscape architect Jens Jensen — responsible in large part for the design or redesign of Chicago’s Columbia, Humboldt, Garfield, and Douglas Parks — agreed to design the Lombard Community Park, now known as Lilacia Park. Today, the park contains approximately 1,500 lilac bushes of more than 300 varieties. People travelfrom all over tovisit the impressive array, particularly during the months of April and May when the flowers are in full bloom and the village’s annual Lilac Festival is in full swing. Just not in the winter; it is Chicago after all.	"This botanical garden outside Chicago boasts an array of more than 300 varieties of lilacs.
