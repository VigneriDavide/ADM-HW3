Findlater Castle	['castles', 'ruins']	526	58	Findlater Castle dates back to the 13th century. The beautiful ruins are built into the cliff edge on a small peninsula, some 50 feet or so above the water and rocky beach below, offering spectacular views of the surrounding Scottish landscape.The name of the castle is believed to come from the Gaelicfionn leitir, which means“white cliff” referring to the quartz in the rock. The structure that remains today dates from a 14th century reconstruction after the castle had been taken over by Viking invaders. The dovecot nearby has been dated to the 16th or 17th centuries.	These ruins are a hidden gem, complete with fantastic views over the cliff edge. 	"['Boyne Castle ', 'Dandy Lion', ""St Drostan's Well""]"	Findlater Castle Barnyard of Findlater Portsoy, Scotland, AB45 2UD United Kingdom	57.6925	-2.7704	['nicolegalbraithx', 'katielou106']	2019-04-03 00:00:00		['Arshi Castle', 'Duffus Castle', 'Eger Castle Replica Ruins', 'Dolforwyn Castle']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/findlater-castle
