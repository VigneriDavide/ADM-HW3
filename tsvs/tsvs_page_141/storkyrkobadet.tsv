Storkyrkobadet	['bath-house', 'pools', 'water']	851	138	This tiny public bath is hiding in plain sight in the most touristy part of Stockholm.Storkyrkobadet is located in a vault, in the basement of a building dating back to the 17th century in Stockholm’s Old Town. The building was originallya Dominican convent during which time the vaultserved alternately as a coal and wine cellar. In the 1890s, the building was converted to a primary school, and the vault became the baths for the students. It would take another half century before a sauna was built and the bath was opened to the public.The bath is still old fashioned in many ways, with its architecture and interior unchanged since it was first built. It consists ofjust one shallow pool and a number of tiny tubs where visitors can sit and relax.Throughout the years, Storkyrkobadet has become a popular meeting point for the gay community, probably because of the separate opening hours for men and women. Sweden’s most famous gay couple, Jonas Gardell and Mark Levengood, met here in the 1980s.Despite its popularity and history, Storkyrkobadet’s existence is in danger.The city planned to close it in the ’80s but thanks to a volunteer organization called Föreningen De Glada Badarnait (“Society of Merry Bathers”) it was able tolive on—at least for another few decades. Facing increasing costs, as of 2016 the future of this hidden oasis is againuncertain, but a small group of enthusiasts are doing everything in their power to keep itopen.Update as of February 2020:Storkyrkobadet is closed for renovations until 2021.Update as of August 2022: The pool is still closed with no clear opening scheduled at the moment.	A hidden bathhouse in one of Stockholm's oldest and busiest neighborhoods is open to anyone who can find it. 	['Tyska Kyrkan Weather Vane', 'Percys Trappa', 'Aifur']	Svartmangatan 20 Stockholm Sweden	59.3237	18.0727	['hrnick', 'molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2016-12-28 00:00:00		['Muroto Schoolhouse Aquarium', 'Lightning Ridge Artesian Bore Baths', 'Dunbar Outdoor Pool Remains', 'Poço Azul (Blue Pool)']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/storkyrkobadet
