Balestrino Ghost Village	['ruins']	851	46	Little is known about the details of the building or the abandoning of this picturesque Italian hill town, but today is stands empty and slowly decaying.

Abandoned medieval hill town. 	"['Slingshot Museum', 'Wall of Alassio', ""Nemo's Garden""]"	Balestrino, 17020 Italy	44.1247	8.1722	['serflac', 'antoine4459']	2011-08-23 00:00:00		['Jekyll Island Amphitheater ', 'Springs Park', 'Warm Springs Ghost Town', 'Rushen Abbey']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balestrino-ghost-village
