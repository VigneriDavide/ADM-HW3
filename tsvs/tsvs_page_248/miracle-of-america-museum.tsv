These are just a sliverof the artifacts on view at the Miracle of America Museum,an in-depth andthoughtful tour of the U.S. as seen through its stuff.The breadth and variety of the eclectic museum’s exhibits, which take up 35 buildings and much of the land surrounding, have earned it the nickname of “Smithsonian of the West.” Its owners and operators, Gil and Joanne Mangels, are collectors in the most extreme sense of the word.Vehicles of all shapes and sizes make up a sizable portion of the collection. More than3,000 motorcycles, some very rare, draw bikers from the highway to the museum. There are World War II and Vietnam-era trucks and helicopters, which patrons are allowed to climb in and steer. In fact, much of the sprawling museum is hands on. Kids are allowed to play with vintage coin-operated games, including player pianos and mini barrel trains. During summer, workshops on blacksmithing, lacemaking, and other arcane activitiesare presented using authentic tools.
