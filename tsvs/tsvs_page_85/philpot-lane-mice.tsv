Philpot Lane Mice Sculpture	['rodents', 'fauna', 'sculptures', 'statues', 'food', 'animals', 'architecture']	1134	410	On a small stripof no man’s landbetween two buildings on Philpot lane, a pair of tiny mice aregnawing at a piece of cheese. This is London’s tiniest publicsculpture, and the origin of these littlecreatures remains a mystery.A plaque indicates that the buildings were constructed in 1861-62, as an office for spice merchants, butit is not known when the sculptedrodents appeared on the scene.The story behind the Philpot Lane Mice most often told is a tragic tale, albeit with little evidenceto back it up.Local legend has it that the micewere created to mark the tragic death of two workers involved in the construction of the nearby Monument to the Great Fire of London. Two workers on this project were perched high in the air and took a break for lunch. One of the men noticed that his cheese sandwich had been nibbled at, leaving very little behind. He accused the friend next to him of eating the sandwich and the men got into a scuffle, which resulted in them falling to their deaths. It was, supposedly, later discovered that the food had been eaten by mice. The theory is that the statues of the mice and cheese were added to remember these men, but this story has been debated and the timelines questioned. Yet, the curiousanimals are still there, chewing away at their tinytreat.	A mysterious pair of mice eating a piece of cheese is London's smallest public sculpture. 	['Pudding Lane', 'Monument to the Great Fire of London', 'The Ruins of St. Dunstan-in-the-East']	23 Eastcheap London, England United Kingdom	51.5108	-0.0842	['ahvenas', 'collector-of-experiences']	2017-04-24 00:00:00	"[""A Rat Lover's Tour of the World""]"	"['Robert Penney Bakery Sculpture', 'Big Blue Bear', ""'Der Hase'"", 'Patsy Ann Statue']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/philpot-lane-mice
