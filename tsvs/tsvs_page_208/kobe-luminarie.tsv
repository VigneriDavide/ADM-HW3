It was intended to only run for one year, but provedso popular the lights have adorned downtown Kobe every year since, illuminating the area with more than 200,000 hand-painted tiny bulbs.The lights were donated by the Italian government and the origin of the event’s name is the Italian word for illuminations using miniature bulbs, “luminarie.”The installation was produced by Italian artistic director Valerio Festi and Kobe native Hirokazu Imaoka. Each year’s display uses thousands of painted lightbulbs powered by biomass for minimal environmental impact.After the earthquake, Kobe had challenges bringing tourists back into the region, and the reoccurrence of the festival also helped to combat this problem. An estimated 4million people come to Kobe each winter to witnessthe spectacular display. The city roads are closed off to any traffic during the festival, allowing visitors to roam the streets freely.The festival has no entry fee but is able to raisemillions from donations and merchandise sales, which isgivento the victims of the great earthquake.	An astounding annual light display honors the victims of one of Japan's most devastating earthquakes. 	['Kitano-chō', 'Takenaka Carpentry Tools Museum', 'Maya Hotel']	Higashi Yuenchi Park 6 Chome-4 Kanōchō Chūō-ku Japan	34.6888	135.1961	['molly-mcbride-jacobson']	2017-03-29 00:00:00		['Tsunami Stones', '185 Chairs', 'Beichuan Earthquake Museum', 'The Oaks Disaster Memorial']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kobe-luminarie
