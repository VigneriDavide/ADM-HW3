The Troll Hole	['toy-museums', 'trolls', 'dolls', 'toys', 'museums-and-collections']	673	133	A hidden gemin the city of Alliance, unknown even to many Ohioans, the Troll Hole has one of the world’s largest collections of trolls. Nearly 3,000 uniquedolls line the walls, including rarities such asninja trolls, a three-headed troll, and a vintageTrollmobile.The Troll Hole Museumwas founded in 2014 by Sherry Groom, who began collecting trolls at the age of five. Over the years, Groom grew her collection troll by troll. The mission was not just to snatch the Guinness record for the wold’s largest troll collection (though she did in 2012), but to amuse and educate children about the fascinating backstory of trolls. Trolls, the toy,were invented in 1959 by Danish WoodworkerThomas Dam and became a huge international crazein the ’60s and again in the ’90s. The toys were designed based on the ugly, mountain-dwellingcreatures first mentioned in Scandinavian and Norwegian mythology back in the 13th century—a history Groom will explain in much detail on her tours (occasionally dressed as “Sigrid the Troll Queen”).The landscape of the Troll Hole Museumis surprisingly elaborate, consistingof a grotto, two waterfalls, a 10-foot troll mountain and troll bridge, and several rooms with different themes. Scattered throughout these features are thousands ofminiature trolls and troll-related items, and rows upon rows of figurines with their trademark colorful wildhair.	A record-size collection of wild-haired troll dolls tells the story of the mythical creature's roots in Scandinavian folklore. 	['McKinley Presidential Library & Museum', 'William McKinley Memorial', 'Leetonia Beehive Coke Ovens']	228 E Main St Alliance, Ohio United States	40.9221	-81.102	['soulcatcher', 'toricrowl']	2017-05-16 00:00:00		"[""Aunt Claudia's Dolls, a Museum"", 'Miniature Museum of Greater St. Louis', 'Don Sshinda Collection', 'Spielzeug Welten Museum']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/troll-hole-museum
