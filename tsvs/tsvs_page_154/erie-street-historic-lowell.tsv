Erie Street, Historic Lowell	['ghost-towns']	813	497	Visiting Erie Street is likewalking into a 1950s post-apocalyptic landscape. From all that is immediately apparent, it could have been abandoned in a hurry andforgottenfor half a century. Rustingcars, trucks, and an old Greyhound bussit desertedalongthe street as if their passengers had suddenly vanished (or worse).Erie Street is most of what is left of Lowell, Arizona, a mining town incorporated into Bisbee in the early 1900s. Much of the town’s residential area was demolished to widen an open-pit copper mine. Losing most of its residents caused the commercial district to struggle, and many businesses failed as a result. Today, the street’s special curiosities includea Harley Davidson repair shop with a now-defunct gas pump andSprouse Reitz Co., a department store that is nearly empty except for a few appliances and a whole pile of mannequin parts.Despite appearing untouched since its decline, further investigation reveals that Erie Street is continually restored by a vibrant and passionate community of residents and volunteers who want to remember a different America. So although you can no longer see a show at Lowell’s movie theateror pay $0.22 for gasoline,the Lowell Americana Project has made it possible to experience the street as a living snapshot of another time. And not everything on Erie Streetis purely decorative—visit the Bisbee Breakfast Club for an excellent Huevos Rancheros.	A living snapshot of a different time in America is preserved and maintained by a community of volunteers. 	['The Shady Dell', 'Bisbee Stairs', 'Mule Pass: Not Quite the Continental Divide']	72 Erie St Bisbee, Arizona United States	31.4307	-109.8946	['cassidyac', 'aimlessandru']	2016-11-04 00:00:00	"[""22\xa0of America's Best Preserved Ghost Towns""]"	['Kiosk Ghost Town', 'Warm Springs Ghost Town', 'Volcano Historic Boomtown', 'The Ghost Town of Phoenix']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/erie-street-historic-lowell
