Trolltunga	['cliffs', 'geological-oddities', 'natural-wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	1304	123	Trolltunga is aspectacular example of the geological oddities that dot the Norwegian landscape.The fittingly named “Troll’s Tongue” sticks out of a vertical mountainside above a 700meter (about 2,300 feet) drop. The scenic cliffoffers a magnificent view of lake Ringedalsvatnet in Skjeggedal. It was made thousands of years agoby water from a glacier freezing off part of the rock.Keep an eye on your feet as there’s no safety rail here. You can take a funicular up part of the way, though it isn’t always functioning. Otherwise, itis roughly an 8 to 10-hour hike roundtrip through mountains and waterfalls to the ledge.In recent years, this spot has become more popular with travelers looking for that perfect Instagram shot. If waiting in line to take a photo isn’t to your liking, this might no longer be a good destination for you.
