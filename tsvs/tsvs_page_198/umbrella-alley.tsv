Umbrella Alley	['umbrellas', 'alleyways', 'outsider-art', 'art']	692	105	Hidden in the middle of Baytown’s Downtown Arts District is an art installation of unique proportions. Umbrella Alley derived from an initiative to beautify the historic Texas Avenue area in Baytown. Down this short alley, over 120 multicolored umbrellas float overhead, casting dancing shadows on the ground and alley walls. Umbrellas of every color create a wonderful, whimsical feel when venturing down the alley. The umbrella installation was created by the Baytown Tourism Team and the mural art was done by the Lee College Art Department. It displays the unique ecology of the Baytown area.	Tucked away down this Baytown alley exists a one-of-a-kind art exhibit of technicolor umbrellas.  	['1940 Air Terminal Museum', 'The Orange Show', 'Smither Park']	124 W Texas Ave Baytown, Texas, 77520 United States	29.7328	-94.9692	['skcrutcher', 'jbot']	2019-11-02 00:00:00	['30 Places to Go Deep in the Art of Texas']	"[""St Catherine's Passage"", 'Bob Gasoi Memorial Art Alley', 'Callejon de Hamel', ""It's A Burl""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/umbrella-alley
