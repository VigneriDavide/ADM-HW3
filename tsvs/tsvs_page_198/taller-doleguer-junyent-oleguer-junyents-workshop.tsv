Following hissuccess in the theatre, he decorated some of Barcelona’s most luxurious bourgeois houses, including Casa Burés and Casa Cambó. He was also leader Catalonia’smodernism movement, a contemporary of Ramon Casas and Pablo Picasso.The Junyent family still resides in the building, but they have opened Oleguer’s preserved workshop to the public for scheduled viewings. The collection is a sight to behold: In addition to Oleguer’s paintings, sculptures, models, and various other works, it contains one of themost complete collections of automata in the city after the Tibidabo Amusement Park.Its fashion collection is also incredibly robust.

The workshop also displays a series of dolls collected by Oleguer’s niece.The workshop is periodically opened for events, where guests can step back in time to the glimmering age of one of Catalonia’s most famous designers.
