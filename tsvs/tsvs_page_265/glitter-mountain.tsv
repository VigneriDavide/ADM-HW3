Glitter Mountain 	['mines', 'intriguing-environs', 'mountains', 'geological-oddities', 'ecosystems', 'geology']	570	75	This “mountain” glitters in the sun, thanks to the small crystals that freckle its slopes. The mountain is actually an old selenite mine. It’s still deeded to the mine owners, though it’s managed by the Bureau of Land Management. It has a brief history and synopsis of selenite and its uses.It’s possible to wander among the small selenite deposits sparkling along the edges of the small pit. It’s a fun and interesting little adventure site suitable for the whole family.	This old selenite mine is dotted with tiny crystals that make it shimmer like it's covered in glitter. 	['Electric Theater', 'Judd’s General Store ', 'Pioneer Heritage Museum']	Old Gypsum Crystal Mine Littlefield, Arizona, 86432 United States	36.9786	-113.464	['kysamijumi', 'blameese']	2019-04-29 00:00:00		['Yuncheng Salt Lake', 'Pokaini Forest ', 'Pertosa Caves', 'Waw an Namus']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glitter-mountain
