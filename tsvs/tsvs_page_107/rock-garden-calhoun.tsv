A stroll through the garden takes visitors to Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral—complete with stained glass windows—to awe-inspiring castles constructed of pebbles and shells.Porcelain people populate various rooms and nooks throughout the structures, while small porcelain animals dot the landscape.The builder of this whimsical garden wasDeWitt “Old Dog” Boyd, one of themembers of the Calhoun Seventh Day Adventist Church. A hobbyist at heart, Boydbegan creating tiny, whimsical villages for hiseight children as a family game. Each time his family moved, Boyd would reconstruct a tiny village for his children, who each had an alter-ego porcelain figure to play with. Then in2007, Boyd began the rock garden in Calhoun, saying“it was to keep me out oftrouble, I’m kind of a scoundrel.”Today, the rock garden is a family endeavor and has beencrafted by Boyd, his children, and their children.The free garden is located behind the Calhoun Seventh Day Adventist Church, and there are religious themes to some of the constructions. One of the towns represents Bethlehem; the Ten Commandments tablets are embedded, broken, in one of the walkways; and some other places have scriptures inscribed in walkways or walls.	Incredible miniature towns and buildings created and decorated with thousands of tiny rocks. 	['The Berry College Campus', 'The Labyrinth of Rome', 'Grave of Brownie the Depot Dog']	1411 Rome Rd SW Calhoun, Georgia United States	34.4629	-84.9827	['tinabhickson', 'jennn']	2018-09-10 00:00:00		['Stone Garden', 'World Peace Flame Pathway', 'Three Sisters Sanctuary', 'Rectory Nurseries']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rock-garden-calhoun
