National Coach Museum	['royalty', 'transportation', 'museums-and-collections']	437	388	Created by QueenAmélia of Portugal in 1905, the Museu Nacional dos Coches or National Coach Museum is the home of the most magnificent and valuable collections of royal coaches and carriages in the world.The carriages reside in what was once theHorse Riding Arena of the Belém Palace in Lisbon. TheNeoclassical building is opulent, with balconies and fine works of many Portuguese artists lining the walls, making it the perfect setting to view these transportation artifacts. The coaches themselves are a sight to behold—each one more ornate and gaudy than the next. One favorite attraction is adorned with a gilded scene showing Lisbon being crowned by Fame and Abundance, and a dragon trampling the Muslim crescent with abandon.QueenAmélia created the museum to showcase the considerable collection of coaches and carriages owned by the nobility and royalty of Portugal, and the assemblage is vast. It does a fine job of displaying examples that span carriage development throughout the 16th-19th centuries—not just in Portugal, but also all across Europe; Spain, Italy, England, Austria and France.	An exquisite collection of fairytale conveyances that puts most car museums to shame. 	['Electricity Museum', 'Jerónimos Monastery', 'Rhinoceros of Belem Tower']	136 Av. da Índia Lisbon, 1300-300 Portugal	38.6966	-9.1984	['rachel', 'comunica']	2014-06-12 00:00:00		['Deutsches Kinderwagenmuseum (German Stroller Museum)', 'Dale’s Wheels Through Time', 'Verkehrsmuseum Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt Transit Museum)', 'National Railway Museum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-coach-museum
