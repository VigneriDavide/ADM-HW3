Ms. Pearl	['world-s-largest', 'roadside-attractions', 'statues', 'animals']	1088	354	Outside of Austin, Texas, off of an uneventful stretch of Highway 71, sits a U-turn worthy site for the squirrel worshiper in us all.Standing at 14 feet tall, Ms. Pearl beckons anywhere from 30 to 100passersby a day from the highway to have their picture taken with her. If you’re wondering why she is clutching a pecan bigger than your head, it probably has something to do with the nearby Berdoll Pecan Candy & Gift Company, a family-owned business that includes a gift shop, a pecan orchard, and an enormously adorable squirrel statue.Originally constructed in August of 2011 by Blue Genie Art Industries for Berdoll, Ms. Pearl received her sassy name from a customer as part of a contest. In 2015, the squirrel goddessreceived a facelift in the form of a fresh coat of paint as well as a deck to support her many worshipers. She is available 24 hours a day and while the nearby gift shop has regular business hours, there is an eternally available vending machine outside the shop with fresh, full-sized pecan pies replenished daily for any late night, squirrel-inspired snacking needs.
