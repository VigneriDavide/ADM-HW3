This living history museum, located about two miles from the site of the original colony, offers visitors a chance to step into 1627 Massachusetts.Henry Hornblower II opened the museum in 1947. He grew up in Boston, but spent his summers in Plymouth, and was fascinated by its history. Hornblowercarried out a number of archaeological excavations around the site of the original colony and wanted to share the story with a wider audience. The museum began with two English cottages and a fort on the historic Plymouth waterfront.Since then, the facility has grown to include a replica of the Mayflower, a colonial village, a water-powered mill, barns, and a replica of an earlyWampanoag village.In the museum’s English Village, visitors can walk through a recreation of Plymouth’s 17th-century farming and maritime community. The exhibit is complete with actors who portrayreal historical residents of the colony.The wooden houses are complete with kitchen gardens, and heritage livestock breeds, andobjects that the colonists would have used in their daily life.Part of the museum’s mission is to share the whole history of Plymouth, which includes the complex interactions of both English and Native cultures. TheWampanoag Homesite is representative of the Wampanoagtribe who inhabited the region at that time. Unlike other parts of the museum, the staff in the Wampanoag Homesite are not role players but Native people from Wampanoag and other nations.At the museum, they dress in clothing accurate to the time period butspeak from a modern perspective about the history and culture of their tribes.	Since 1947, this living history museum has been providing an immersive look at life in Plymouth Colony. 	['Pilgrim Hall Museum', 'National Monument to the Forefathers', 'Myles Standish Burial Ground']	137 Warren Ave Plymouth, Massachusetts, 02360 United States	41.9382	-70.6254	['keslar', 'isabella-connor']	2020-01-28 00:00:00		['Museo de América', 'James Museum of Western & Wildlife Art', 'Palace of the Governors', 'Verde Valley Archaeology Center']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/plimoth-patuxet
