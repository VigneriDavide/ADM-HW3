Boon Island Light	['cannibals', 'lighthouses', 'islands']	868	144	Six miles off the shore of York, Maine, lies a small pile of desolate rocks, usually inhabitedonlyby sea birds and occasional colonies of seals. Known asBoon Island, this rocky outcropping is home to New England’s tallest lighthouse, Boon Island Light, which stands 133 foot tall and makes the tiny shoalidentifiablefor miles.Before the lightwas built in1855, however, Boon Island wasnotoriously dangerous for ships.Most famously, the British merchant vessel,Nottingham Galley,wrecked on the island inDecember 1710. Of the Nottingham Galley’s 14 crew members, two died due to injuries sustained inthe wreck, and two died aboard a makeshift raft in adesperate attempt to reach shore. The remaining ten sailors, who could see the mainlandclearly, though they could not signal for rescue, stayed alive for 24 days without shelter, food, or fire. Only byeating the remains of their dead compatriots were they able to survive. Afterthe tenwererescued, theirstory of cannibalism and survival on the islandmade itinfamous.After many years of light keepers on the island, today, Boon Island is uninhabited and the light is operated by solar power. When visiting by boat,despite themassive towerof the lightlooming over you, it is still easy to imagine how desperate and alone theNottingham Galley crew must have felt. The rocks are barren and unfriendly looking, while shore seems just out of reach.It’s well worth a day trip to see one of New England’s most notorious shipwreck sites, and to make you grateful that you can return to shore. If appreciating Boon Island from the safety of the mainland is more appealing to you, it is easily visible on a clear day from any of York’s sandy beaches.	New England's tallest light house stands on an island with a history of cannibalism and death. 	['Wiggly Bridge', 'York Witch Grave', 'Smuttynose Island']	York, Maine, 03909 United States	43.1212	-70.476	['ekoeze', 'aprildg']	2015-08-03 00:00:00		['Farol da Ponta dos Rosais', 'Slate Islands', 'Kõpu Lighthouse', 'Charity Island Lighthouse']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boon-island-light
