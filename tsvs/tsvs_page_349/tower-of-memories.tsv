Tower of Memories	['mausoleums', 'tombs', 'towers', 'catacombs-and-crypts', 'cemeteries', 'architecture']	459	193	Just west of Denver, the remains of thousands of bodies areentombed in a lonely white tower that overlooks the city.Rising 158 feet tall above Olinger Crown Hill Cemetery, the building is nearly a century old and is home to about 6,000 crypts and 5,000 niches for cremated remains.Breaking ground in1929, this towering tomb, dubbed the Tower of Memories, donned a hefty $1 million price tag. The original builder actually went bankrupt a year before the project was finished, but constructioncould not be halted as the building already housedthe remains of many bodies.Instead, new architects were hired and the originally intended Gothic architecture was stripped from the plans,leaving behind the modernist granite structure that watches over Denver today. Construction againwas halted during World War II, but finally finished in the 1950s. Today, the monumental building is a historic landmark of Denver. Inside it also features achapel with eerie red stained-glass windows, adding to the macabre atmosphere of this strange place.	A seven-story 1920s mausoleum outside Denver houses thousands of remains. 	"['Casa Bonita', ""Davies' Chuck Wagon Diner"", 'The Terrorium Shop']"	7777 W 29th Ave Wheat Ridge, Colorado United States	39.7589	-105.0827	['ahnafkalam', 'collector-of-experiences']	2018-11-15 00:00:00		['Mountain View Mortuary and Cemetery', 'Blue Sky Mausoleum', 'Howard Mausoleum Pyramid', 'Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tower-of-memories
