Leslie Nielsen's Gravesite	['catacombs-and-crypts']	460	127	Leslie Nielsen wasn’t going to move on to the next world without having a little fun.So the legendary comedian’sgravesite in Ft. Lauderdale is more playful than you’re likely to find in most cemeteries.Located in picturesque Evergreen Cemetery, a witty inscription on his otherwise simple headstone reads “Let ‘er Rip,”a play on the actor’s often flatulence-inspired comedy. The gravesite is actually far less grand than one would expect of a famous Hollywood icon, but it’s not without its hidden treasures;the grave site’sbench is marked with another Nielsen-centric inscription that reads “Sit down whenever you can,” which was widely known to be his standard line of advice for actors or comedians who asked him for advice.	A self-explanatory attraction allows fans to respectfully remember and honor a comedy legend. 	"[""'Thrive'"", 'Mai-Kai Restaurant', 'Old Ghosts of Hollywood ']"	1300 SE 10th St Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33312 United States	26.1064	-80.132	['dylansko', 'captgrelden']	2012-02-12 00:00:00		['Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery', 'Café in the Crypt', 'St. Louis Cathedral', 'Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leslie-nielsen-s-gravesite-2
