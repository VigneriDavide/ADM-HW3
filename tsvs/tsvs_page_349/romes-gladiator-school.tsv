Rome's Gladiator School 	['combat', 'gladiators', 'schools', 'roman', 'military-history', 'military']	461	118	Tucked away on a side-street of the Appian Way, one of the most crucial and strategic of all Roman roads, the Gruppo Storico Romano (Historic Roman Group)has been recreating one of the most brutal and enthrallingbits of Rome’s history for nearly two decades.The group’screator, and indefatigable leader is Sergio Iacomoni, but during camp hours he prefers the name“Nero.” Along withfour of his coworkers, Nero came up with the idea of gladiator school whileworking at the Bank of Italy. Instead of more common pastimes, the merry band of friends decided to recreate their own period-correct ancient Romansuits and put them to the test oneSunday morning at the Colosseum.To quoteIacomoni, “From that first time, I knew it would be successful.”Events unfolded quickly thereafter– proving the veracity ofIacomoni’s hunch that first day – leading to the founding of Gladiator School on a private plot of land. Attached to the training grounds is a museum packedwith original and recreated memorabilia from Rome’s heyday of battling to the death.The Schoolis entirely self-sustained through the private and group gladiator classes and the commissions for events, nationwide and abroad, serving interested parties ranging in age from children to spry grandparents. As a living, breathingmodern reproduction of the castrum (or Roman military defense camp), participants in Gladiator School partake in everything fromtwo-hour courses up to twice-weekly classes in which participants acquire themental and physical skillsnecessary forparticipating in mock life-or-death combat.Supplemented with lectures on the history of gladiators, knowledgable professionals like Nero instruct students acrossa progressive curriculum of offensive and defensive techniquesnecessary to throw down like a bona fidegladiator. Starting withproper shield-wielding, students progress to sword use and bodily stances, before returning to them to the modern world with a working knowledge of the secrets that onceelevatedancient Rome’s most deadly warriors into living gods.	This historic recreationist school churns out warriors that may very well have had a fighting chance in Rome's pits of the day. 	['Via Appia', 'Vigna Randanini', 'The Martyr Murals at Santo Stefano Rotondo']	Via Appia Antica 18 Rome, 00179 Italy	41.8689	12.5024	['fabianaformica', 'littlebrumble']	2015-11-19 00:00:00		['Barsalloch Fort', 'The Lanchester Diploma', 'American University Experiment Station', 'Roman Walls of Lugo']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/romes-gladiator-school
