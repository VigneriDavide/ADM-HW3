Llechwedd Caverns Trampoline Park	['playgrounds', 'mines', 'mountains', 'caves', 'ecosystems']	1209	188	Wales produces some of the world’s finest slate; the Romans used it to build their empire’s castles. In Victorian times miners blasted the precious material out of the side of mountains, but as other building materials grew more popular the demand for slate dropped off and left many mines abandoned.But why dither on the past when you can seize an abandoned mine as an opportunity? Just add trampolines.The Llechwedd Caverns in the townof Blaenau Ffestinioghave been transformed into a trampoline playground aptly named Bounce Below. Huge springynets suspended underground propel visitors around the old mine to create a unique subterranean bounce park.You enter via an old mine train and are then presented with a staggering maze of 10,000 square feet of nets.There are three trampoline levels, one at 20 feet, one at 60 feet and the tallest at 180 feet off the ground. To movebetween trampolines, you can take an industrial-sized slide, crawl through a tunnel, or descend a spiral staircase deepinto the cavern.
