Frankie's Tiki Room	['tiki', 'bars', 'unique-restaurants-bars', 'shops']	1643	683	No trip would be complete without a drink at a local watering hole, and the curious traveler seeks out a spot with personality. Enter Frankie’s Tiki Room.A kitschy tiki aesthetic has along history on the Las Vegas scene but with the closingof Tiki classics like Don the Beachcomber and Aku Aku at the Stardust in the 1980’s, Tiki establishments were becoming an endangered species. A short-lived bar called Taboo Cove opened in The Venetian in 2001 but closed in 2005. Las Vegas was temporarily Tiki-less.That changed when in 2008 owner P. Mossbought the50s-era Frankie’s Bar & Cocktail Lounge and brought tiki back to Las Vegas in a bigway. Working withBamboo Ben, the grandson of tiki pioneer Eli Hedley, Moss created custom Frankie’s Tiki mugs and lined the interior with thatch and bamboo decorations and lit it with appropriately dim lights inside pufferfish lighting fixtures.The drinks are terrific blends of classic tiki and creative tiki riffs. The number of skulls on the drink indicates how much booze is in them (after a few “five skullers” you may wake up wondering how many skulls you have).That a day among bombs and boneyards could end on a tacky tropical island is just one more example of Las Vegas’ unending capacity to provide the unexpected—off The Strip, it’s remarkably easy tohit the jackpot.	The best Tiki bar in Las Vegas.  	['Burlesque Hall of Fame', 'Zak Bagans Haunted Museum', 'The First Telephone in Las Vegas']	1712 W Charleston Blvd Las Vegas, Nevada, 89102 United States	36.1592	-115.1646	['dylan', 'collector-of-experiences']	2014-06-07 00:00:00	['17 Hidden Las Vegas Spots It Would Be a Sin to Miss']	"[""Trader Vic's"", 'Mai-Kai Restaurant', 'The Tonga Room', 'The Shameful Tiki Room']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/frankies-tiki
