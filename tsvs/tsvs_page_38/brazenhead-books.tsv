Brazenhead Books	['bookstores', 'books']	1646	120	Brazenhead Books is a bookstore located insidea private apartment, existing just outside the laws of retail, where a sense of impishness and wonder pervadesthe air.Once inside, the beloved bookshop’s owner,Michael Seidenberg, delights in entertaining visitors with a meandering taleof Brazenhead’s earnest conception. Begun in a sub-sidewalk retail space on Manhattan’sUpper East Side, located just a few steps below street level, its current reincarnation is now in a semi-undisclosed location in Midtown.Even in its earliest form, as a non-secret retail bookstore, Brazenhead was adoredby its patrons. However, the fanaticismof the bibliophile crowd wasn’t enough to stave off skyrocketing rent, forcingSeidenberg to take move hisoperation underground in 2008. Hilariously, this move involved taking Brazenhead’s stock several stories upward, into Seidenberg’sapartment. Away from the prying eyes ofcity zoning officials, the bookstoresettled intoits most permanent, legendary existence, where the man and his wares shared a living space 24/7. Inside this world where proprietor and books existed side-by-side, patrons were free to come and go as they pleased, so long as they made an appointment. Seidenberg would also throw open his doors to host the occasional party by invitation only, whose attendees were largelythose of a creative and literary type.Gradually, word of mouth turned Brazenhead into a bona fide speakeasy of books, with publicationsranking it among the most stunning bookstores anywhere on Earth.By late 2015, however, Seidenberg was once again facing the potential death of Brazenhead when an eviction notice forced him out of the apartment that had been his and Brazenhead’s home for so long.Yet, as the curtain lifted the following year, Brazenhead had, against all odds, once again magically resurrected. This time it finds a new life in a secretMidtown location.Despite its move, thislaissez-faireatmosphere of the salon-book-party remains at Brazenhead’s new location, where Seidenberg still cohabitates with manyprecious volumes, all for sale at a range of prices accessible to the common man and collector alike. Once again bibliophiles’ secret temple is open for pilgrimages, so long as one is willing to put in the legwork to make an appointment with Seidenberg, whereupon Brazenhead’sexact address will be disclosed.Update: As of June 2019, Brazenhead Books has closed indefinitely.	A legendary speakeasy bookstore returns from the brink. 	"['The Conjuring Arts Research Center', 'The Little Church Around the Corner', ""Tannen's Magic Shop""]"	Available on request.
