Leadenhall Market	['markets', 'film-locations', 'film']	7564	3133	The ornate 19th-century painted roof and cobbled floors of Leadenhall Market, located in the historic center of London’s financial district, make it a rathermagicalplace to do a bit of shopping—even before it played a starring role in theHarry Potter films.This covered Victorian marketis one of the oldest markets in London, selling meat and fish as farback as the 14th century. The current green and red roof, however, was constructed in 1881 and made Leadenhall Market a popular attraction in London.The marketplacewas featured a few times in theHarry Potterseries—it was the film location for some of the original exterior shots of Diagon Alley, the cobblestoned shopping hub of the wizarding world where Hogwarts students can stock up onschool supplies like spellbooks and wands.Today if you wander down the market’s Bull’s Head Passage you may recognizethe blue doorof an optics shop (an empty storefront at the time of shooting)as the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in Goblet of Fire. In the films, the magical Diagon Alley is accessible to wizards and witches from London through the Leaky Cauldron, an unassuming pub wedged next toa record store. If only that were true for us Muggles.	This ornate Victorian marketplace was the setting for Diagon Alley and the Leaky Cauldron in the Harry Potter films. 	"['The Cornhill Devils ', ""London's Original and All-Inspiring Coffee House"", 'Philpot Lane Mice Sculpture']"	London, England, EC3V United Kingdom	51.5126	-0.0834	['meghanneal', 'julius-spada']	2016-08-01 00:00:00		['Rivendell', 'Bagdad Cafe', 'Gare de la Ciotat', 'Drvengrad']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/leadenhall-market
