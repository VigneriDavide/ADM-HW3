It’s eye-openingto crouch down in an air raid bunker and experience how it must have felt when the situation was for real.These are just a couple of examples of the unique experiences offered at Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin). The museum offers tours of some of Berlin’s most important underground structures, such as bunkers, abandoned subway stations, air raid shelters dating back to World War II and tunnels for smuggling people out of East Germany during the Cold War.Berliner Unterwelten wasfounded in 1997 to explore, document and preserve the city’s subterranean architecture. The organization’sbase is in a former air raid bunker in the Gesundbrunnen subway station, now amuseum—the Unterwelten Museum (Subterranean Museum)—that offers various tours through Berlin’s underground. The bunker was cleared and reconstructed by the group and transformed into a museum while maintaining its originalcharacter. Hiding onfour floors below Berlin aredozens of bunkers, tunnels, walkways, canals, the routeof a pneumatic postal system, storage rooms, bomb and ammunition storage, and abandoned subway stations.Berlin, so full of history above ground, has a lot to tell in its subterranean areas as well.There areexhibits about everything from air raid bunkers to the removal of rubble from the destruction during World War II. Berliner Unterweltenfound a huge file system about slave workers during the war in a forgotten bunker, helped the former workersto receive reparation pay and have an exhibition about slave workers in Berlin. Found objects such as ammunition, grenades, gas masks, etc. are on display as well. There is anexhibition about Hitler’s “Germania,” hisutopian visionto rebuild Berlin. (The exhibition shows that the project was not, of course, a utopiaafter all.)Berliner Unterwelten also works to preserve subterranean areas. They havedug and cleared out many locations, including half-destroyed bunkers, and opened them to the public. Several different tours are offered, including underground bunker hospitals, mother-and-child bunkers, flak bunkers, subterranean factories, examples of subterranean escape routes from East to West Berlin, flak towers, an underground prison, Cold War bunkers for nuclear war and a tour through the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy tower built to test the possibilities oferecting Germania on the sandy ground of Berlin.	A tour of underground Berlin takes you through WWII air raid shelters and tunnels used to smuggle people out of East Germany. 	['Humboldthain Flak Tower', 'Kaninchenfeld (Rabbit Field)', 'Silent Green Kulturquartier']	105 Brunnenstraße Berlin Germany	52.5478	13.3893	['christine-williamson', 'anna90everson']	2016-09-29 00:00:00		['816 Underground Nuclear Plant', 'Newhaven Fort', 'Parque el Capricho Bunker', 'Jhaishan Tunnel']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berliner-unterwelten-subterranean-berlin
