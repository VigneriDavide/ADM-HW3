Dwan Light Sanctuary	['colleges', 'temples']	1511	153	Located on the campus of the United World College, the Dwan Light Sanctuary uses prisms instead of windows to transform the light that enters the building into a lattice of rainbows.The peaceful room was created by Virginia Dwan as a multi-purpose space for meditation, reflection, or even religious practice. Eschewing a singular purpose that might make the sanctuary less than welcoming for some people, the space allows visitors to turn the stark white space into their own escape. The open layout is completely unadorned save for the giant prisms built into the ceiling and apse of the building. With no other decoration to distract the eye guests can simply meditate on the rainbows that are projected on the walls and floors as natural light passes into the room. Many universities offer quiet rooms and study halls, but none may be so artful or forward thinking as the Dwan sanctuary. 	A futuristic temple of light uses prisms and rainbows to create an atmosphere of peace.Â 	"['Fort Union National Monument', 'Pecos National Historical Park', ""Pigeon's Ranch""]"	Las Vegas, New Mexico, 87701 United States	35.6522	-105.2766	['rosieate', 'briankmoe']	2014-02-19 00:00:00		['Positivist Temple of Porto Alegre', 'Bunhwangsa', 'Karpur Baoli', 'Denden-gu']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dwan-light-sanctuary
