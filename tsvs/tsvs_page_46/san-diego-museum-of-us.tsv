It started out as The California Building, housing a central exhibit of the expo, headed byarchaeologist Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett. The exhibit, called“The Story of Man through the Ages,” was so popular that a group of citizens decided they would like to make the collection permanent fixture, and formed theSan Diego Museum Association and invited Dr. Hewett to act as the director of was was, by 1942, officially an anthropological museum.Part of thethe “California Quadrangle,” the building that houses the museum is a brilliantly ornate, almost church-like structure with a beautiful 200-ft. tall tower containing an electroniccarillon and chiming clock. The tower would be recognizable to film buffs as part of the Xanadu estate in Orson Wells’Citizen Kane. It closed to the public in 1935 and reopened 80 years later after a restoration.Besides housing several interesting and unique temporary exhibits with subjects that cover everything from10,000 years of beer-brewing history to “Cannibals: Myth & Reality,” the museum is known for its impressive collection ofAncient Egyptian antiquities, one of the most extensive in the U.S.This remarkable display includes aPtolemaic child’s coffin, one of only 6 in existence, and several authentic mummies, including theLemon Grove Mummy—afemale cadaver stumbled upon in a nearby suburban garage after being found in a cave in Mexico and stashed there by two teenagers.The museum is located in Balboa Park, and holds several annual special events and educational opportunities. It is the only anthropological museum in the city of San Diego.	An extraordinarily ornate museum in San Diego holds wondrous anthropological treasures. 	['Balboa Park Botanical Building and Lily Pond', 'Spreckels Organ Pavilion', 'San Diego Model Railroad Museum']	1350 El Prado San Diego, California, 92101 United States	32.7314	-117.1517	['rachel', 'prestonw']	2014-06-24 00:00:00		"[""St Cecilia's Hall"", ""Siegfried's Mechanical Music Cabinet"", 'Museum of Sound', 'Estey Organ Museum']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/san-diego-museum-of-us
