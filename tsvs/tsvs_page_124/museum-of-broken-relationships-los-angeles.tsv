Los Angeles' Museum of Broken Relationships	['relationships', 'love', 'collections', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	920	172	Two Croatian artists, Olinka Vistina and Drazen Grubisic, broke up. But rather than tossing the material effects of their lost love, they decided to open a museum dedicated tohousing the runoff of broken relationships. The location in Zagreb proved so popular that it spawned a second Museum of Broken Relationshipsin Los Angeles.The concept is simple: If your heart has been broken and you are left with reminders of your lovertoo precious to throw away but too painful to keep, send them in to the museum with a briefdescription. In the quiet, minimal space, seemingly mundane objects are put ondisplay with nothing butexplanation offered by the anonymous donor.The exhibit offers a tender look atthe intimacy of others. Some objects, like a wedding dresses and teddy bears, are easily read. Others are more obscure — mannequin hands, a plastic flamingo straw, several used emery boards, etc. The descriptions invite questions, laughter, gasps, and of course, tears. The Museum of Broken Relationships is one partmelancholy, one part cathartic, and totally sigh-inducing.	Where the leftovers of love affairs can live on forever. 	['Capitol Records Building Morse Code', 'Hollywood Tower Apartments', 'Chase Mosaic Movie Montages']	6157 Hollywood Boulevard Los Angeles, California United States	34.1017	-118.324	['molly-mcbride-jacobson', 'ncianciola']	2016-08-10 00:00:00		"[""Zagreb's Museum of Broken Relationships"", 'Booze History Museum', 'Stazione Neapolis', 'Museo De Arte Virreinal (Museum of Viceroyalty Art)']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-broken-relationships-los-angeles
