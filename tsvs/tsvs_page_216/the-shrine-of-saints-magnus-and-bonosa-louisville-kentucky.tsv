Shrine of Saints Magnus and Bonosa	['skeletons', 'bones', 'shrines', 'saints', 'churches', 'sacred-spaces']	655	197	How did the 1800-year-old bones of two Christian martyrs from ancient Rome come to a city famous for horse racing, basketball, Muhammad Ali, chicken and whiskey?St. Martin of Tours is a Catholic parish church in central Louisville that is one of the city’s few remaining antebellum public buildings. It is also (hopefully) the only building in Louisville that contains two ancient holy skeletons.One of the oldest parishes in the oldest inland archdiocese in the United States, St. Martin of Tours sprang up in 1853 in Louisville’s Phoenix Hill, once a largely immigrant neighborhood, today mostly African American.The new Franciscan church served a booming German immigrant population that could no longer fit into the downtown cathedral.Tragically, on Election Day 1855, armed mobs of anti-immigrant “Know-Nothings” — an American political party influenced by conspiracy theories about Catholic takeover of the United States — suspected that a hoard of weapons was hidden inside St. Martin’s and tried toburn it down. At least 20 people died in the riots, andstories reported that whole Catholic families were burned to death in their homes nearby. “Bloody Monday” caused thousands ofCatholics to pack up and leave, arguably crippling Louisville’s rise as a city.While Catholicimmigrantswere far more acceptedfifty years later,twopackages that showed upat Louisville’s U.S. Customs Office on New Years’ Eve 1901 must have giventhem cause to reflect on persecution. Sent from Italy, the boxes contained two unlikely “immigrants.” These were the bones of Saints Magnus and Bonosa, Roman martyrs killed when Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire.Tradition holds that Bonosa was a Roman virgin executedfor her Christian beliefs, maybe during the reign of Septimius Severus in the 3rd century C.E. or under Diocletian, who in the 4th century ordered one of the largest and bloodiest official persecutions of Christians.As for Magnus, one story has it that whileBonosa was being put to death at the Colosseum, this man — allegedly a Roman centurion — was so moved by her couragethat heconverted and eventuallywas executed for the deed. Another tale says that Magnus stepped into the ring, fought to save the young Bonosa’slife, andwas killed on the spot. Yet even the Catholic Church recognizes it’snot certain whoMagnus and Bonosa were, and these stories are hard to verify.Whoevertheywere, the remainsnow in Louisville were probably firstinterred in the Roman catacombs or in an Italian cave centuries ago. In the 1700s, they made their way to a Cistercian convent in Anagni, in the hillseast of Rome, where the nuns probably placed thembeneath an altar.How, then, did the bones get to the Bluegrass State?To the irritation of many Italians, much of Italy was once governed by the papacy — a fact not unknown tothe nativist mob that attacked Louisville Catholicson Bloody Monday, 1855. In the 1800s, during Italy’s turbulentunification, ananti-clerical backlash led its government to start shutting down manymonasteries. Some Italians began to see old bones as just superstitiousrelics. For safety’s sake, many of these human remains were sent to the United States.With the permission of Pope Leo XIII, Magnus and Bonosa were packed up, sewn into bags, and shipped to Kentucky in 1901, then installed in the sidealtars at St. Martin’s. Louisville parishioners sewed regal-looking purple garments to clothe the bones, as well as crowns representing the martyrs’ salvation. Whenrestoration to the church got underway in 2012, the early 20th-century garments were found to be seriously decayed and later were burned out of respect for their status as holy objects. During a Solemn High Mass (conducted, appropriately enough, in Latin) the bones were placed in new side altars on September 9, 2012.Philip DiBlasi, aUniversity of Louisville archaeologistwho studied the remains in 2012, attests that the female skeleton, still amazingly complete, is that of a “100% Caucasian” woman aged about 24. Magnus’ bones are less than half complete. DNA testing shows that he was in his late 40’s and had mixed European andAfrican ancestry. DiBlasi hadCT scans conducted at a Louisvillehospital so his team willeventually be able to do facial reconstructions.Though we’ll probably never know for sure who these individuals really were, the remains give a fascinating, if ambivalent, glimpse into ancient history.
