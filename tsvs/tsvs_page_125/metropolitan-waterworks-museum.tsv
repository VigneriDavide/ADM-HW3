Metropolitan Waterworks Museum	['waterworks', 'retro-tech', 'museums-and-collections', 'museums']	918	286	The Metropolitan Waterworks Museum is located at the original Chestnut Hill Reservoir and pumping station. Built in 1887, it pumped the water for Boston until the supply source was shifted to the Quabbin Reservoir in the 1970s.It was left to disrepair and treasure hunters until the Friends of the Waterworks began advocating for its preservation in 1991, and in 2005 Massachusetts passed legislation allowing the sale of the site for re-development with preservation restrictions.Containing amazing architecture and remarkable machines, the museum consists of the Great Engines Hall which houses three historic steam-powered pumping engines.	Beautiful steampunk ghosts of early Massachusetts.Â 	['Cypress Street Playground', 'John Eliot Memorial', 'Last Known Whereabouts of Barbara Newhall Follett']	2450 Beacon Street Boston, Massachusetts, 02467 United States	42.333	-71.1546	['mmvk', 'martin--2']	2012-07-23 00:00:00		['National Telephone Kiosk Collection', 'Asheville Pinball Museum', 'Dimitrie Leonida Technical Museum', ' Shattuck Windmill Museum']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/metropolitan-waterworks-museum
