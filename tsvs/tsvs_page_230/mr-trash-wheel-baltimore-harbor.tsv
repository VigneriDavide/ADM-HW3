Mr. Trash Wheel	['solar-power', 'garbage', 'trash', 'rivers', 'infrastructure']	628	747	Anyone who lives near a river can tell you: When trash doesn’t make it to a garbage can, it almost always ends up in the water. Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, which links Jones Falls to the Chesapeake Bay, is not exempt from this. As the sole outflow for the Jones Falls Watershed area—which covers 58square miles of the city—the harbor used to be filled with the city’s refuse, turning whatwas supposed to be a lovely waterfront district into a sort of wet-garbage-front district.Enter Mr. Trash Wheel. Officially named the “Inner Harbor Water Wheel,” and invented by a former dock manager who was tired of seeingjunk float by him every day, this charming, minibus-sizedgizmo has taken on cleanup duty for the whole harbor.It works like this: Long, floating containment booms positioned at the mouth of Jones Falls herdfloating trashintoMr. Trash Wheel’s general area. Then, rotating underwater forks grab the trashand push it onto an angled conveyer belt, which pulls it into a dumpster. The moving parts are all powered by a waterwheel, with backup froma flat of solar panels. (The gathered trash is later incinerated, to generate electricity.)According to the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore’sofficial website, since his first dayin May of 2014, Mr. Trash Wheelhas removed over one million pounds of trash from the harbor. His monthlyhaul includestens of thousands of plastic bags, chip packets, and cigarette butts,as well as the occasional errant sports ball.The site also featuresa livestream, in case you want to see such an accomplished garbage-gobbler in action. But if you’re in the area, it’s worth going to pay your respects—there’s nothing like watching a cute machine happily eat trash.	This bug-eyed water wheel uses the power of the Sun to clean up Baltimore Harbor. 	['The American Visionary Art Museum', 'Fell Family Cemetery ', 'The Horse You Came In On Saloon']	Jones Fall Expy.
