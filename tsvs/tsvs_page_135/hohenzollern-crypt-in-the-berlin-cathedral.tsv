Ninety-foursarcophagi and burial monuments range from the end of the 16th century to the beginning of the 20th, spanning four centuries of Brandenburg-Prussian burial culture.The Hohenzollern dynasty has its roots in the Holy Roman Empire; the house ruledthe Duchy of Prussia as well as served as the Electors of Brandenburg. They parlayed this power into creating the Kingdom of Prussia and, subsequently, the German Empire. They ruled the Empire as Kaisers, benefiting from the realpolitik genius of Otto von Bismarck before destroying themselves in the bloody nightmare that was World War I.The current Berlin Cathedral was built in 1905, partly destroyed during World War II, and basically left in ruin till 1975, when it was finally decided to restore it. The Berlin Cathedral was rededicated in 1993. However,thesmall but significant funerary complex it sits on top of dates back to the late 16th century, and itsrestoration is still ongoing.The historic cryptincludesa wide variety of artistic styles.From simple to very ornate, some of these final resting places are in better shape than others. Among the most notable sarcophagiare those of Frederick I and Sophie Charlotte, the first King and Queen of Prussia and the grandparents of Frederick the Great. The cathedral’s dome was bombed during World War II, and the resulting collapse and fire damaged and destroyed some of the crypt. An extra charge to tour the crypt goes towards the ongoing restoration and care for this collection.Be sure to view the surreal video explaining what happens to child Royals when they die.

Beneath the impressive baroque cathedral that rises from the center of Berlin lies the largest collection of Prussian royals in the world.  	['The DDR Museum', 'AquaDom at Radisson Collection Hotel, Berlin', 'Marx and Engels Forum']	Am Lustgarten 9 Berlin, 10178 Germany	52.5192	13.4011	['lairarsefltnn', 'rlhyzer']	2016-06-29 00:00:00		"['Cartuja de Miraflores', ""King's Chapel Crypt"", 'St. Cataldus Catacombs', 'Hermitage of St. Albert Butrio']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hohenzollern-crypt-in-the-berlin-cathedral
