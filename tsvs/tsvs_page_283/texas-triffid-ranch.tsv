Texas Triffid Ranch	['science-fiction', 'plants']	544	72	Billing itself as “Dallas’s pretty much only carnivorous plant gallery,” the Texas Triffid Ranch started as a regular vendor at local science fiction and horror conventions before opening its first gallery in a dying shopping mall in 2015.In its current location, since March 2017, the Triffid Ranch specializes in custom unique enclosures for Asian, South American, and Australian pitcher plants (genera Nepenthes, Heliamphora, and Cephalotus, respectively), sundews (Drosera), butterworts (Pinguicula), bladderworts (Utricularia), and other carnivores, both on commission and based on owner/operator Paul Riddell’s background in science and science fiction art.
