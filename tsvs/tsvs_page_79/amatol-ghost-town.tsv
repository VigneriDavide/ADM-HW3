Amatol Ghost Town	['wwi', 'weapons', 'factories', 'ghost-towns', 'abandoned', 'ruins']	1179	190	During the last years of World War I, a new explosive was invented to help stretch the depleting stores of TNT. It was called Amatol, and in 1918, shortlyafter the United States entered the war, a munitions plant and adjacent factory townwere established in New Jersey named after the explosive theymanufactured.Amatol, New Jersey, was built on 6,000 acres of land in the Pine Barrens. The planned communitywas short lived: After World War I ended that same year, Amatol became a vacant town. The homes were deserted and the plant shut down. Because most of the buildings were built to be temporary, they were dismantled and little was left behind. The factory was eventuallydemolished.The structures that were left behind were made out of concrete, and if you make the hike out into the woods and look closely you can see the remnantsof the former munitions village: piles of concrete that were once houses and concrete foundations where structures once stood.You can also see hints of the racetrack that was built in 1926 on the site of the formermunitions plant. The Amatol Racetrack, also known as the Atlantic City Speedway, was thebiggest raceway on the East Coast at the time. Made out of wood, it was a 1.5-mile oval track, about50 feet wide. You can still see the oval outline of the old speedway via Google Earth (coordinates: 39°36’4.59”N, 74°44’37.10”W), an eerie glimpse of where the raceway once existed.	In the woods of New Jersey lie the ruins of a munitions village abandoned after World War I and the remnants of a 1920s wooden racetrack. 	['Batsto Village', 'Emilio Carranza Memorial', 'Mighty Joe the Gorilla']	Amatol Raceway Hammonton, New Jersey United States	39.6013	-74.7436	['57butler', '7c1abf81-a0aa-488e-b3a1-0f11a1470e0e']	2017-05-02 00:00:00		['Warm Springs Ghost Town', 'Perlora Ciudad de Vacaciones (Vacation City)', 'Conata', 'Borgo Amerigo Fazio']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/amatol-ghost-town
