Treepod Restaurant	['restaurants', 'unique-restaurants-bars', 'trees', 'islands', 'plants']	472	31	The Treepod Restaurant on the island of Koh Kood, Thailand, may be the only eatery in the world where the servers wear harnesses.Diners must make a short trek through the island’s beachside rainforest to reach their “pod.” These egg-shaped, handmade structures are built by a resident craftsman from locally sourced bamboo and rattan, and resemble the nests of native birds. The pods are hoisted by electric cables 36 feet in the air to float among the rainforest canopy. Patrons enjoy unobstructed views of the Gulf of Thailand while their waiter soars through the massang trees on zip-lines with their food. Much of the menu is sourced from the eco-resort’s organic garden, featuring Thai classics, seafood, and fresh fruit platters.The real-life dreamscape is the brainchild of Graham Grant, manager of Soneva Kiri Resort, which owns the Treepod Restaurant. The eco-resort is true to its nature, sourcing its building materials locally and banning imported bottled water. Koh Kood is a large and sparsely populated island, allowing visitors to spend some alone time with the birds, like birds themselves.	Eat like a bird in a bamboo nest. 	['The Kingdom of Somchai’s Affection', 'Bamboo Trains', 'Killing Caves of Phnom Sampeau']	110 หมู่ 4 Tambon Ko Kut Amphoe Ko Kut, 23000 Thailand	11.6971	102.5313	['lukefater', 'icatsstaci']	2019-08-15 00:00:00		['The Treehouse Restaurant at Alnwick Gardens', 'Prubechu', 'The Rock', 'Da Gairdins']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/treepod-restaurant-thailand
