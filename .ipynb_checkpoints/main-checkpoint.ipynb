       "  'Murals of Maxo Vanka',\n",
       "  'Created in protest against industrial capitalism, World War I, and the rise of Fascism, the paintings are the work of aCroatian expatriate artist, Maximilijan “Maxo” Vanka, referred to by David Byrne of the Talking Heads as “The Diego Rivera of Pittsburgh.” If you prefer legend to history, that’s here too - St. Nicholas Catholic Church is also the site of one of Pittsburgh’slesser-known ghost stories.Maxo Vanka (1889-1963) is most likely the illegitimate child of Hapsburg nobility. Born in the days when Croatia was stillpart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the infant Vanka was given to a peasant woman named Dora and raised in a small village outside of Zagreb. At the age of eight, his maternal grandfather learned of his existence and brought him to a castle to be educated. Vanka went on to study art in Zagreb and Brussels, graduating with top honors in 1914, the year World War I broke out. The 25-year-old artist–already a confirmed pacifist–joined the Belgian Red Cross as a medic and saw some of the worst horrors of the war on the Western Front.In the 1920s, Maxo Vanka became one of his country’s leading painters, but in 1934, with Fascism on the rise in Europe, he immigrated to the United States.St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Millvale, Pennsylvania was part of the first ethnic Croatian parish in the U.S. St. Nicholas’s priest in 1937, Father Albert Zagar, commissioned Vanka–an immigrant like most of hisown flock–to paint a set of murals in the church. Vanka was an unorthodox choice for the job of creating what has been called “Pittsburgh’s Sistine Chapel.”  Though he described himself as spiritual, Vanka wasn’t a practicing Catholic, he was friendly to Socialist politics, and married to an American Jew (Margaret Stetten, daughter of a New York surgeon).Over the course of eight weeks between April and June1937, the artistcompleted the first round of murals–twelve paintings all told. The restwere finishedin the summer and fall of 1941,just months before the U.S. entered World War II.Though Vanka’s Millvale murals depict a plethora of traditional Christian religious themes, he brilliantly wove his own anxieties into the old Christian story, graphically illustrating the evils of Capitalism, the horrors of war, and Croatia’s “crucifixion” by theUstaše - a Fascist organizationthat was also fiercely Catholic and anti-Semitic. The murals are an incredibletranslationof Christian motifs into 1940spolitics. In The Battlefield Scenes, Jesus and the Virgin Mary arebayoneted by Christian soldiers; in another, the angel Injustice wears the garb of a nun and a gas mask, and holds a bleeding sword and a set of scales in which money outweighs bread; in Mati 1941, a femaledepiction of the artist’s belovedCroatian homelandhangs with her arms chained to a cross, shedding tears of blood.Several of Vanka’s murals delve into the travails of American labor. In Immigrant Mother Gives Her Sons for Industry, the dark mills and mines of western Pennsylvania–once the kingof American steel production–burn ominously in the distance while a dead worker lies on a Croatian newspaper surrounded by weeping mothers. In The Capitalist, an American industrialist in a top hat eats a sumptuous breakfast brought in by a black servant. As this king of industry (a jab at Pittsburgh’s rich) pores over a stock report, an angel shuns him and a skeletal hand containing fire reaches out toward him. The year is 1941.Several of Vanka’spaintings could be set either in Europe or America. In The Simple Family Meal, a working-class family dressed in traditional Croatian clothing shares a meal. Their heads are bowed in prayer while Christ, unseen except by the little girl (who Vanka modeled after his daughter Peggy), visits and blesses them.Around the altar and under a large painting of the Virgin Mother and Child (Mary, Queen of Croatia), Vanka’s countrymen in folkdress gather for their morning prayer (Pastoral Croatia). Vanka stated, “These murals are my contribution to America – not only mine, but my immigrant people’s, who also are grateful, like me, that they are not in the slaughter of Europe.”Then there’s the ghost. One night in 1937, a contemporary legend goes, Vanka was up late, hurrying to finish the first round of murals. That’s when he saw “The Millvale Apparition” - the title of an article published in Harpers Magazine in April 1938 and written by Vanka’s good friend Louis Adamic. Folklore has it that this was the ghost of a former pastor who neglected his priestly duties and was paying penance for failing to serve the parish well. Although Father Zagar was present, only Vanka saw the “black-robed figure making gestures at the altar.”Maxo Vanka went on to teach art at Delaware Valley College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, but never acquired widespread fame in the U.S. His Millvale Murals remain his greatest work. In 1963, while swimming off the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, he is thought to have suffered a heart attack and drowned in the Pacific. His widow and daughter donated many of Vanka’s works to the Croatian Academy of Science and Arts and the Michener Museum in Doylestown, PA.Tragically, Vanka’s murals were nearly lost to air pollution and salt damage caused by water. In justa few short decades, Pittsburgh’s notoriously dirtyair and the lack of air conditioning inside the churchtook a severetoll. The fine details of the murals were also obscured by the lack of lighting in the church. Professional lighting and restoration is ongoing today–with some dark squares left in a few places to show the extent of the filth that once covered these murals. Formed in 1991 as a nonprofit separate from the church, The Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka’s (SPMMMV) mission is to clean and restore the murals, install new lighting to improve visibility and enhance the visitor experience, and improve public information and access. As of 2020, SPMMMV has restored and permanently lit half of the Murals. The restoration is spectacular and thesehistoric paintings–an amazing testimony to the coming together of faith, art, and social justice–are one of the city’sbest off-the-beaten path attractions.',\n",

       "  'Mercer Museum and Fonthill Castle',\n",
       "  'Henry Chapman Mercer, a renowned archaeologist, tile maker, and collector of Pennsylvanian pre-industrial household utensils wrote of his home, Fonthill:“The house was planned by me, room by room, entirely, from the interior, the exterior not being considered until all the rooms had been imagined and sketched, after which blocks of clay representing the rooms were piled on a table, set together and modeled into a general outline. After a good many changes in the profile of the tower, roofs, etc., a plaster of Paris model was made to scale, and used until the building was completed.”Finished to Mercer’s exact specifications in 1912, Fonthill remains an ornate, architecturally unclassifiable mansion constructed entirely out of poured concrete.Besides being an archaeologist, Mercer was a self styled anthropologist, ethnographer, and perhaps most importantly, collector. When Mercer began to collect artifacts for his museum, his aunt informed him that she had a vast collection of medieval armor. Mercer was delighted, as he wanted the Mercer Museum to contain not only relics of American history, but world history as well. The armor was kept in storage in Boston while Mercer continued to collect. But the storage building was made of wood, in the year 1872, the Great Boston Fire destroyed much of the city, and all of Mercer’s armor.Devastated, Mercer realized that he could not risk fire erasing his collected Americana before future generations could learn from them, and concrete was his answer. The people of Doylestown thought he was crazy, spending years immersed in building his concrete castles, but Mercer had the last – possibly crazed – laugh when, years later at the completion of Fonthill, he climbed to the very top terrace and built a huge bonfire, high enough for all of Doylestown to see. Fireproof.Today Fonthill displays evidence, both inside and out, of a reason to Mercer’s madness (including a professed “unbending hostility to ugliness and false taste”), although the architectural rhyme and reason—dormer placement and roof pitch, 32 staircases balanced by only eight bedrooms—are only fully understood by Mercer himself. Ornamentally the same holds true: vaulted ceilings are decorated with glittering inlaid tiles taken from Mercer’s factory and personal ceramics collection, despite the walls remaining untouched by paint.Among Mercer’s collection held at the Mercer Museum (located close to but separate from Fonthill), are the everyday tools and things of the average American in the 18th and 19th centuries, from a watchmaker’s gears, to the wares in a tortoiseshell comb maker’s shop, butcher’s instruments, even a whaler’s boat. Keep your eyes out for the fake, but neat looking, vampire hunting kit.The often mentioned haunting of Fonthill’s woods adds a bit of paranormal flair to an already eccentric establishment, though Mercer no doubt would have found it gauche to have the former housekeeper terrorizing his evening guests.',\n",

       "  \"Sir Ernest Shackleton's Crow's Nest\",\n",
       "  'Update as of December 2021:The Crow’s Nest is currently out on loan, visiting Athy in Ireland and South Georgia, to commemorate the centenary of Shackleton’s final voyage.All Hallows-by-the-Tower is a church with a mysterious secret in the basement.Founded in 675, and located just by the Tower of London, it is the oldest church in the City of London and is steeped in history. Samuel Pepys watched the great fire of London from its spire, noting“the saddest sight of desolation.” John Quincy Adams was married here, to local parishioner Louisa Catherine Johnson in 1797 while serving in London for the Washington administration, and in fact Louisa was the first First Lady to have been born outside the United States. Due to its close proximity to the Tower, most of the beheaded victims of the Tower’s executions were buried here. The pub next to the church is suitably called the “Hung, Drawn, and Quartered.”But hidden away in the crypt below the church is a peculiar artifact: the original crow’s nest from the ship Quest, which was the vessel that was fielded on Sir Ernest Shackleton’s final voyage.By 1920, Shackleton was on the verge of obscurity. With nowhere near the legendary status he is viewed with today, and his star truly eclipsed in the minds of the British public by Sir Robert Falcon Scott, Shackleton was on the lecture circuit. While monuments were being erected all over Britain to Scott, Shackleton, drinking heavily, toured the country telling the tale of his doomed Endurance voyage, some three years before.In 1921 Shackleton decided on another polar voyage. With funds drawn from his friend John Quiller Rowett he chartered a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, naming her Quest. His expedition’s goals were somewhat vague, but were loosely centered on exploring “lost” sub-Antarctic islands, such as Tuanaki.The Quest was a schooner-rigged steam ship of 111 feet. With much of the same crew from the Endurance,the Quest left England on the 24th of September, 1921. Shackleton reached South Georgia by January, 1922, but by this time, his health was rapidly deteriorating. He’d already suffered a suspected heart attack en route, in Rio de Janeiro, but Shackleton continued drinking. In the early hours of January 5th, he summoned the expedition’s physician Alexander Macklin to his cabin.According to Macklin’s retelling of the night, he told Shackleton that he had been overdoing things and should try to “lead a more regular life,” to which Shackleton answered: “You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?” “Chiefly alcohol, Boss,” replied Macklin.Moments later, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack and died in his cabin aboard the Quest. Emily Shackleton wired the expedition, requesting that her husband’s body be buried in South Georgia, where he rests to this day, in the remote Grytviken cemetery. Macklin recorded in his diary, “I think this is as the Boss would have had it himself, standing lonely on an island far from civilization, surrounded by a stormy tempestuous sea, and in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits.”The Quest survived World War II, working as a mine sweeper, but was eventually sunk by ice in 1962 off the coast of Labrador whilst on a seal hunting expedition. Shackleton’s original cabin was saved, as well as the crow’s nest, before the ship sank. The cabin ended up in Norway, with plans to restore it and send it to the South Georgia Polar Museum.But the answer to the mystery of how the crow’s nest found its way from the frozen seas of north east Canada to a church crypt in London can be found on a plaque attached to it. It bears the inscription “brought here by Tubby in Quest of Siller for Talbot House.”“Tubby” was the then-vicar of All Hallows, the Reverend Philip Clayton. Nicknamed “Tubby” whilst serving as chaplain on the Western Front during the World War I, he opened the Talbot House as a rest home for wounded and shellshocked soldiers. “Siller” was an Old English name for money, being a Scottish variant of silver. The Reverend Tubby Clayton would tour with the crow’s nest using it as an attraction to raise funds for his Talbot hospice. Following the armistice, Clayton opened further Talbot Houses in London, Manchester, and Southampton.At the back of All Hallow’s church today, a narrow staircase leads the way into the crypt. The original Roman road is still here, perfectly preserved. Walking past the church register, opened to the day John Quincy Adams was married here, you take the narrow subterranean passage to a small underground chapel. The altar is made of stone, taken from Richard I’s castle Atlit, built during the crusades by the Knights Templar. And around the corner amidst such mysterious surroundings lies the crow’s nest from the Quest. Hardly known about or visited, along with the rescued cabin it is all that remains from the final voyage of Sir Ernest Shackleton.',\n",

       "  'Rosslyn Chapel',\n",
       "  'In Roslin, a picturesque Midlothian village as tiny as it is unknown, stands the enigmatic Rosslyn Chapel, one of the finest examples of Scottish Gothic architecture in existence.The Rossyln Chapel shouldn’t be regarded as another decaying ruin like the hundreds of haunted castles you’ll find in your Scotland explorations. Popular among mystery enthusiasts and treasure hunters, (especially since Dan Brown sourced it in his bestseller) the chapel has stirred the imagination for over 500 years, while the atavistic stories, old as time and Christianity itself, are still being spread in the modern day. Described as “a poem of stone, powered by stars,” the infamous miniature temple represents more than a religious landmark for many, and its breathtaking sculptures question the realities of our occidental history, unexpectedly morphing it into epic fiction.From the Dance Macabre motif to the Seven Virtues, or the Nordic dragons to the over 100 pagan “Green Men” figures, the sculptural ornaments adorning the church are sometimes misleading. They comprise a syncretic iconography that is one of the more puzzling of the European Heritage, an architectural brain teaser that presents a quirky reexamination of the knowledge of our past. Needless to say, the speculative theories that emerged around Rosslyn caused a surfeit of enraptured minds and sleepless nights for the relentless art historians, freemasons, and conspiracy aficionados that investigated the case.Here is a handful of historical facts that can be confirmed:Founded as a collegiate church around 1450 by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness and Baron of Roslin, it was a Roman Catholic place of worship, serving polyphonic masses and religious ceremonies for the Sinclair family until the Scottish Reformation in 1560. Closed to the public in the 18th century, it reopened later as a Scottish Episcopal Church and then fell into disrepair, serving as a melancholic setting for British painters of the Romantic movement and their evocation of spiritual introspection.In the 14th century, at the high point of the Crusades debacle, Templar Knights scattered throughout Europe to flee King Philip IV’s prosecution and threats of death by fire. The myth goes that a small group of fellow knights flocked into Scotland with the coveted Templar treasure they were bedeviled for. Finding support under King Robert the Bruce, the legend says, they hid their gold and holy relics in several locations across the territory, one of them being the vault of Rosslyn Chapel. The surreal list of artifacts that were (and might still be, according to some inspired historians) being kept in and under the Chapel is positively stunning – the embalmed head of Jesus Christ, his wooden cross, the Holy Grail, scrolls of Gospel by Christ himself; or in brief, the entire Christ’s Passion set of regalia.Add to that the Himalayan-sized mountain of gold composing the treasure of the Templar and it adds up to quite a legendary treasure. It’s no wonder that the Rosslyn Church got such attention.While no specific concrete evidence has been found of the treasure, the church itself apparently bears here and there discreetly carved symbols representing the two riders on a single horse, the well-known seal of the Templar.On the other side of this legendary spectrum, the Scottish rites of Freemasonry, questing for authentic historical evidence of their symbolic heritage and to validate their filiation with the Templar Knights, used the unusual symbol to legitimize the antiquity of their past. The so-called “Apprentice Pillar,” a singular double ellipse-shaped column, (said to depict the crisscrossing of a DNA sequence) became, through the lens of the Masonic interpretation, the tangible proof of one of the founding myths of Freemasonry.A jealous Master Mason allegedly murdered his apprentice, hitting him on the forehead with a hammer, for the absurd crime of having built a pillar intuitively without having traveled to see the original column, thereby short-cutting the building process.Others affirm that the Rosslyn Chapel’s plan was modeled after the Temple of Solomon. In 1996, the churchwas also featured in The Hiram Key, where masons Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas presented theories on the origins of Freemasonry. In their controversial text, the two authors defend the theory that carvings surroundingsomeogive-shaped windows are adorned with a maize motif, a type of corn only found on the American Continent. According to them, the presence of corn-shaped sculptures, fifty years before Columbus discovered the New World, demonstrates that William Sinclair traveled to Americana before the Italian navigator.More recently, the colossal renovation plan and stonework repair project has undergone to save the crumbling Rosslyn Chapel outed another surprising fact. After invasive jackdaw nests damaged the roof pinnacle to the point where it was ready to collapse, workers took the unstable structure apart brick by brick and revealed a small chamber specifically made by the stonemasons to contain a beehive. The apiary is still active and can be located on the eastern-southern side. There is a face next to a metal drainpipe and a stone depicting a flower.As the most recent unusual fact surrounding the chapel, the centuries-old honeycomb, long since emptied of any insects, seems to prove that the arsenal of mysteries lurking in the old countryThe church contains other structural features. The easternmost arched doorway is a “whispering door,” where confessions were given. The priest standing at the lefthand side and the guilty murmuring their transgressions on the right. The only words carved into the structure can be located on an arch just before the steps to the crypt. The medieval carving, translated from Latin, reads: “Wine is strong. The King is stronger. Women are stronger still. But truth conquers all.” It has been noted that the ornate imagery of the chapel was to educate and impress both illiterate and educated worshipers.',\n",

       "  'Cementland',\n",
       "  'It was once the trash heap of local industry. An abandoned and run down former cement factory, the decrepit lot on Riverview Drive had become a common site for local construction crews to dump truckloads of excess dirt and rock. The old factory meant so little, no one cared or tried to reroute them.But when sculptor and visionary Bob Cassilly looked at the site, he saw something more. He saw an art amusement park celebrating the history of cement production in St. Louis, filled with statues and sculptures and old machinery turned into fascinating attractions, and that’s what he began to build in the space.Locations with formerly booming industries often find themselves with the opportunity to celebrate their cultural and economic history with an amusement park exhibiting that glory. Southern Indiana, known for its famous limestone quarries, has its half-constructed limestone pyramid. In Vietnam, there is the Suoi Tien Cultural Theme Park, celebrating the local Buddhist tradition.Bob Cassilly had already put St. Louis’s name on the oddball art park map with the City Museum, a sprawling playhouse built from repurposed industrial and architectural objects. Cementland was his opportunity to create again, this time with acres to expand.So he got a bulldozer and combined it with his artistic ambition. The park would fit right in with his long history of whimsical, playful sculptures and projects, all hinging on the intersection between childhood nostalgia and subversive counterculture. He invited the construction crews to keep dumping their leftover dirt — it was simply more material for him to play with. To create with.Before long he had created a castle of sorts out of the old factory, with a courtyard of sculpted creations made of cement, rock, metal and antique machinery. Bridges spanned spillways and depressions where water would collect into pools to form moats and ponds. In short order, people caught notice, and couldn’t wait to see what the project, still in its infancy, would eventually become.Unfortunately, in 2011, Cassilly tragically died when the bulldozer he was operating allegedly tipped off of an unstable ledge and rolled over, although his widow and several medical experts believe he was intentionally beaten to death, the bulldozer accident simply being a cover-up. Regardless, he died doing what he loved, but what he loved was far from finished.Today, the unfinished park, still closed to the public, is an attractive spot for oddity searchers, sculpture fans, graffiti artists, and late-night teenagers. There are no illusions that it is complete or well-maintained at this point, but Bob’s widow, Giovanna Cassilly, hopes to keep the project going. She launched a website to collect inquiries and information for curious and supportive fans.After years of probate proceedings, the 55-acre Cementland was released to her in the fall of 2015 and building may resume.Memorials to Bob Cassilly have been held in the park, candlelight vigils and the launching of lit balloons into the night sky. But perhaps the best memorial to the man, his life, and his ideas, is all around you when you visit - the park itself.Update December 9 2016:A heavy warehouse fire raged at the cement factory, causing the roof to fall in. Over 60 firefighters worked through the night to put out the blaze.Update May 2017:A private security outfit has been hired to prevent trespassing.Update Feb 2022: No evidence of any security. Area is now considered unsecure and may now be explored by those at their own risk. Wide opening in fence located Mississippi Greenway Trailhead.

However, perhaps after being informed by the US Postal Service that there was another Santa Fe and showing up to the post office wearing the same dress was totally gauche, the town changed its name to…Santa Claus.That means that the post office is the Santa Claus post office. And the police department is the Santa Claus PD. And the DMV is the Santa Claus DMV, but…maybe not so jolly.If there are Grinches in Santa Claus, they don’t make themselves known around Christmas, when volunteers respond to each and every letter to Santa that comes through the post office. That’s right. Every kid who is smart enough to figure out that Santa has an entire town named after him and write to him there gets a personal letter in return from the Santa Claus Elves. Volunteer elves have been doing this since 1914 (it is doubtful that this is what caused WWI).There is plenty to do in Santa Claus. There is Santa’s Candy Castle, where Santa’s woodworking shop can be found and actual toys are made (sorry kids, no Transformers–just stuff made of wood). Kids can also play with toys in various buildings representing various toymakers. There is theSanta Claus Museum, housing a number of Santa Claus mummies. Just kidding. It’s actually all about the history of the town and its transition from Santa Fe to Santa Claus.TheHoliday World & Splashin’ Safari is a Holiday-themed amusement and waterpark (originally named Santa Claus Land) once visited by Ronald Reagan. It offers non-frostbitey wintery watery fun for the whole family. You can also visitFrosty’s Fun Center (mini-golf, snacks, etc.), which doesn’t sound at all like the setting for an 80s slasher flick. Dad can play the links at the Christmas Lake Golf Course, and the kids can feed apples and carrots to the depressed horses in Santa’s Stables.If you are feeling like your Christmas isn’t Christmasy enough, you know where to go.',\n",

Macabre memento-mori sculptures, designed to inspire piety, can be spotted throughout the city.The death of an emperor or empress was a major event. As one of the major imperial royal dynasties of Europe, as well as the Holy Roman Emperors from 1438 to 1740, the Habsburgs ruled over much of Europe until their downfall in World War I. For many Habsburg monarchs their death meant not only the creation of an elaborate and beautiful sarcophagus for the Imperial Crypt, but also a silver urn to preserve their heart and reliquaries to contain their embalmed entrails. After the funeral, the parts of the deceased would part ways, to be interred in three separate holy crypts.Twelve emperors, 18 empresses, and 113 other members of the Habsburg family are interred in the Imperial Crypt (Kaisergruft) in Vienna. The crypt, also known in German as the Kapuzinergruft (“Capuchins’ Crypt”), holds 105 metal sarcophagi, the most elaborate of them designed by the royal sculptor Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. The Rococo double sarcophagus of Emperor Franz Stephan and his wife Empress Maria Theresa is considered his masterpiece. The royal couple lie on top of the tomb, surrounded by elaborate reliefs illustrating scenes from their lives.The hearts of 54 members of the royal family are held in special urns in the Herzgruft, or “Heart Room,” located a few blocks away in St. George’s Chapel of the Augustinerkirche, and the embalmed entrails of princes, queens and emperors are kept in the Ducal Crypt below the St. Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom).The Imperial Crypt below the Capuchin Church and monastery was originally intended to hold only the remains of Empress Anna and Emperor Matthias, who died in 1618 and 1619. The crypt was expanded many times over the centuries to accommodate more royal remains: first in 1657 by Emperor Leopold I, again in 1754 by his daughter the Empress Maria Theresa, then again in 1908 by Emperor Franz Joseph. The buildings were restored more recently in the 1960s.Emperor Franz Joseph’s sarcophagus is the only one made from stone instead of metal. Itis flanked by the coffins of his wife Elisabeth and son Rudolf. It was Rudolf’s mysterious and tragic suicide (after murdering his 17-year-old mistress) in 1889 that began the downward trajectory of the Habsburg Empire. Because Rudolf left no male heir, the crown was passed from Franz Joseph to his nephew, Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in 1914 tipped off World War I. Charles I, Franz Ferdinand’s heir, became the last emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Neither Franz Ferdinand nor Charles, however, is interred in the Imperial Crypt. Franz Ferdinand is interred with his wife Sophie in Artstetten Castle, Austria. Charles is interred with his wife Zita in the Church of Our Lady of Monte, in Madeira, and their hearts are held at the Loreto Chapel of Muri Abbey in Italy. Archduke Otto, the last Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was interred in the Imperial Crypt following his death on July 4th, 2011. He is the last Habsburg to be interred there.',\n",

       "  'Prague Astronomical Clock ',\n",
       "  'The legend of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town of Prague seems to have come straight from the Brothers Grimm. The dark tale is set in the fifteenth century, when the clock is said to have been created by the great clockmaker Mikuláš from Kadaň. Such was the reputation of his craftsmanship that Mikuláš was approached by many a foreign nation, each wishing to have its own town square topped with a marvelous astronomical clock. Mikuláš refused to show the plans of his masterpiece to anyone, but word got back to the Prague Councilors.Overcome with fear that Mikuláš might build a bigger, better, and more beautiful clock for another nation, the Councilors had the brilliant clockmaker blinded, ensuring that their clock would never be topped. Driven mad, the clockmaker took the ultimate revenge, throwing himself into his extraordinary work of art, gumming up the clock’s gears and ending his own life in one stroke. In doing so, he cursed the clock. All who tried to fix it would either go insane, or die.While this is only a legend, it stands as a testament to the extraordinary nature of the Prague Astronomical Clock. The clock has been modified, destroyed, and repaired many times since its creation in 1380. It is perhaps the most well-known astronomical clock in the world, with four moving automatons (including a skeleton ringing his death knell for each hour), and rotating statues of the 12 apostles. It displays Babylonian time, Old Bohemian time, German time, and Sidereal time. It also shows the moon’s phases and the sun’s journey through the constellations of the zodiac. The calendar dial, just below the clock, shows the day of the month, the day of the week, feast days and allegorical pictures of the current month and sign of the zodiac.Though the legend of Mikuláš is apocryphal, Prague is not without a dark history - the cobblestones of the Old Town Square below the clock are marked with 27 crosses commemorating 27 beheaded Czech noblemen. Be sure to go upstairs for a tour of the interior of the fascinating clock.In Czechia, the Prague Astronomical Clock is known simply as the Orloj, from the Latin word horologium.As the saying goes, imitation is the highest form of flattery. When it was created, the Prague Astronomical Clock was an outstanding technological achievement. In modern times, Koreans fascinated by the Orloj built a working replica of the clock and the tower of the Old Town Hall. Their building in Seoul is called Castle Praha Hongdae.Update January 2019: After nine months of restoration—the most extensive since the 1940s—the clock has been returned to its former glory and is back on view.',\n",

       "  'In Catalán, Bellesguard means “Beautiful View.” In designing Bellesguard, Antoni Gaudí provided Jaume Figueres and his wife with an unrivaled view that stretchesto the Mediterranean Sea. Unfortunately, Jaume Figueres never benefited, he died within weeks of agreeing to the work.It’s difficult to find a vantage point to observe the Barcelona skyline quite as uninterrupted as this. Thelocation, shadowed by the Collserola mountain, was where the last Count of the House of Barcelona lived, protected inside a medieval fortress. Gaudí was determined the new house should complement the remains of the 15th century castle. He even added stones to some of the original walls, five centuries after the House of Barcelona fell.Set a few kilometers from his most popular works in L’Eixample, the house rarely gets talked about in the same breath as Casa Milà or Casa Battló. However, since 2013, visitors have been able to tour both the grounds and the house, while marveling at Gaudí’s synchronous design of art nouveau and neo-gothic forms.The 1900 project provided Gaudí with a canvass to celebrate Catalan heritage. He also used it as an opportunity to mourn the loss of influence suffered by the House of Barcelona. It came to a sudden end in 1410 when Martin I, “Martin the Humane,” wasn’t able to secure his illegitimate heir’s accession to the throne. Motifs throughout Bellesguard point to the passing of this dynasty and its maritime influence across the Mediterranean.To pay homage, Gaudí adorned the house with a cross of four arms, which he colored red and yellow representing the Catalan flag. To give proud expression to his Catholic faith, visitors can see tributes to the Virgin Mary, and a Holy Trinity of windows in the main facade. As visitors enter, an inscription reads, “Maria Purrisima sens pecat fou concebuda,” which means “Purest Mary, conceived without sin.”The project is best conceived as a poem to Catalunya’s glorious past. On the grounds, the mosaic benches designed in the famed Trencadís technique feature symbols from the Kings of Aragon and that staple of Gaudí artworks, the Cross of St George.One mosaic bench welcomes the sunrise to the east and one catches the shadows of the sunset to the west. Together with a mosaic image of a fish, the eternal symbol of maritime rule, visitors sense how crucial nationalist identity was to Gaudí. In rendering one part of the house in darker colors to denote Martin I’s death, visitors can sense how saddened Gaudí was Barcelona never enjoyed the same influence again.Gaudí’s deep personal connection to the project meant his obsessive focus soon frustrated Jaume Figueres’s widow, who by 1909 could no longer afford the works. Work came to a halt and some of the upper levels are still undecorated.Years passed and during the Spanish Civil War, it’s believed nuns and children came here and burnt wood to keep warm. In 1944, it was bought by a family of medics, the Guilera family. At various points, chemotherapy patients were brought here for treatment, and later, it was used as a gynecology clinic. Music concerts took place in the attic room and further decorations were added to fulfill some of the original promises of Gaudí’s work.The rooftop view overlooks the Sarrià province, which in 1900 was uninhabited. It allows visitors to observe the key modernist feature of the house, a brick dragon composed of nostrils and eyes where some (but not all) of Gaudí’s windows were installed.Inside the building, pay special attention to the ceilings. Many of them represent the so-called “Catalan arch,” which uses a structure of overlaid layers of bricks.He was said never to have visited once the work was completed, with some of his apprentices taking the main responsibility for the mosaics. As the work progressed, he became more consumed with La Sagrada Familia. At Bellesguard, visitors can enjoy his life’s devotion and the twin influences of history and nature, but on a more intimate scale.',\n",

It is a full-scale maze, with several dead ends and multiple paths punctuated by six raised bridges, all of which surround a central tower.The maze is part of the 8,000 acres that have been the home of the Marquesses of Bath since 1541. 900 of those acres were laid outby the famous landscape designer Capability Brown, who also had a hand in the grounds of Alnwick Castle (now home to the Alnwick Poison Gardens). The property includes a slew of unusual features, not least of which is the Safari Park of exotic animals that has been open to the public since 1966. Designed as the first drive-through safari park, thereover 500 wild animals canroam freely. According to the Safari Park web site: “Despite the understandable initial concerns of locals with regard to the introduction of lions to Wiltshire, the Safari Park concept has been a great success and Longleat’s ground-breaking innovation has been repeated at wildlife collections all over the world.”Before his death in 2020, the land was owned by the 7th Marquess of Bath, Alexander Thynn, known primarily for his eccentric lifestyle, numerous mistresses, and the erotic murals he painted all over the residential portion of the house. He was also a great lover of mazes, and added the hedge maze, as well as three other smaller garden mazes: the Lunar Labyrinth, the Sun Maze, King Arthur’s Maze, and the Love Labyrinth.The historic house, gardens, hedge maze, and safari park are open to visitors.',\n",

       "  'While exploring Edinburgh, it’s easy to walk by pieces of the past without even realizing it. Some of the walls, which blend in seamlessly with even the newer buildings, have their own centuries-old histories that hint at the city’s former fortifications.The Flodden Wall was completed in 1560 to protect the city against an English invasion that never came. After Scottish forces were defeated and King James IV was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, Edinburgh officials feared the victorious English troops would soon descend upon the ancient Scottish city. So, as leaders who fear outsiders tend to do, they decided to build a wall to defend their domain.The 24-foot-tall wall encased a 140-acre area. About 10,000 people lived within its confines. Six ports guarded the entrances in and out of the walled city, which also helped control smuggling.Though the English never did actually invade after the Battle of Flodden, the wall played an important role in protecting Edinburgh from the turbulent times that rocked the city during the 16th century, when different groups attempted to besiege the castle. The massive cannon Mons Meg was even used to destroy the buildings snipers had settled in outside the wall.The Flodden Wall, along with the other two walls built to encase the city, was eventually ruined in the 18th century. As Edinburgh expanded, the barriers became a hindrance rather than a help. Roads and buildings like the University of Edinburgh’s Old College were constructed over crumbling sections of the abandoned walls. Part of the Flodden Wall that surrounds Greyfriars Kirk was even destroyed in what is believed to have been a freak lightning strike.The few fragments of the Flodden Wall that survive are protected monuments. The portion around Greyfriars Kirkyard is the most well known, but you can also see stretches of the old stones where Drummond Streets meets the Pleasance and on Forrest Road. ',\n",

It was the Napa Valley of its day.By the 1860s, however, the combined effects of cheap whiskey, a vinediseasethat attacked the plants, and labor shortages during the warkilled off most Ohio Valley vineyards, and Midwestern wine productionshifted north to Lake Erie’s shoreline.Even during antebellum days, Kelleys Island, Ohio, wasat the center of Lake Erie’s burgeoning “grape belt.” In the mid-19th century the island’s grape growers formed a co-op, the Kelleys Island Wine Company. Using native stone quarried just up the road, they built a large, impressive commercial winery on the island.The beautiful stone winery resembled a feudal castle, and processed about 350,000 gallons of wine and champagne eachyear, pressed from grapes grown throughout island.Steam-powered presses on the upper story crushed the grapes, which were fermented below, then bottled or stored in casks in the underground cellars. Every winter, workers driving horse-drawn sleighs cartedhuge wooden casks filled with wine across a frozen Lake Erie to Sandusky on the mainland, where the popular wine was sold around the world.Though Prohibition in 1920 killed offbreweries and wineries across the nation,Kelleys Island Wine Company and the island’s otherwinery, Sweet Valley Winery (renamed Monarch in 1902) survived by producing non-alcoholic grape juice.The first building’s demise came on August 15, 1933, when sparks from a small locomotive at arock quarry ignited a grass fire that consumed the neighborhood. The blazedestroyed the winery and the charred structure was left in ruins. Monarch Wine Company, the only wineryto open again after Prohibition, survived until 1950.

       "  'What appears to be a piece of expressionist art—a man falling headfirst towards the pavement—is actually a memorial for a Hungarian revolutionary, Péter Mansfeld, who was martyred for the cause in 1959.The Hungarian Revolution began with students, who mounted a peaceful demonstrationagainst the Soviet regime in Budapest on October 23, 1956. Unrest had been brewing for some time, evidenced by the 200,000 people who turned out to call for an independent Hungary. They dismantled communist icons and flags throughout town. Many of the activists were just teenagers, includingPéter Mansfeld, then just 16 years old.When protest leaders attempted to storm the Radio Budapest building to broadcast a list of their liberation demands, they were stopped by the Soviet Secret Police. The crowd grew unruly, the police opened fire, and all hell broke loose. Central Budapest was a war zone for the months to come, the streets lined with burning cars and police barricades.The Soviet police attempted to hide their weapons throughout the city in places like empty ambulances,but the protesters found and stole them. As the revolution was winding down, Péter Mansfeld and four other teenage freedom fighterscontinued hoarding guns and grenadesin the event the rebels needed them again. They broke into the Minister of the Interior’s villa to steal ammunitions, and narrowly escaped a plainclothes police officer on their way out. In 1958 they stole a car and kidnapped a police officer on another weapons mission. The youngest of the revolutionaries grew frightened as the authorities circled closer on the five boys, and told his parents, who, as loyal communists, turned them in immediately.While police were investigating the site where the guns were hidden (beneath Budapest Castle), Mansfeld made an escape, leaping from a 13-foot-high ledge in the Rose Hill neighborhood and breaking his hand in the process. This escape was futile though; he was found the very next day.Mansfeld had been arrested earlier in the month for stealing a car and disseminating anti-Communist leaflets on the street. These offenses, coupled with charges of abduction, theft, harboring arms, and committing violence against the state were evidence enough of his deviance. The Soviet government planned to make an example of the five young rebels.It was determined that Mansfeld and his companion, József Blasko, werethe ringleaders. The prosecution urged the judge not to go easy on the accused because of their age, but instead to orderthe most “draconian rigors” possible for the political traitors. Blasko was given a life sentence, while Mansfeld wassentenced to death. Because he was only 17, he would live out the rest of his short life in custody of the Soviet Secret Police. Mansfeld was held and tortured in jail until after his 18th birthday, when he was hanged. The execution was allegedly botched, and it took the young revolutionary 13agonizing minutes to die.Péter Mansfeld became an icon of the revolution, especially the thousands of teenaged martyrs who died for Hungarian independence. This statue, and one in Veronika Park, commemorate the national hero’ssacrifice. This statue on Szabó Ilonka Street is sometimes called “Man Falling Into Death.” It depicts Mansfeld plummeting through the air in his fall atRose Hill, twisting in fear towards his ultimate end.',\n",

The young Hammond Jr. pestered Edison with so many questions that Edison took him under his wing and acted as his mentor, remaining Hammond’s friend until his death.Hammond would indeed follow in the inventor’s prolific footsteps becoming second – to Edison himself – for the most invention patents filed. Hammond served on the board of RCA, and did significant work on remote control via radio waves, earning him the title “the father of remote control.” (Technically, that honor belongs to Nikola Tesla.)A passionate traveler, Hammond had a deep love of all things European and historic. In a letter to a friend he wrote “You can read history, you can visit a hundred museums containing their handiwork, but nothing can reincarnate their spirit except to walk through rooms in which they have lived and through the scenes that were the background of their lives. It is a marvelous thing, this expression of human ideals in walls and windows.”Hammond certainly expressed himself in the walls and windows of his New England home: a medieval-style castle complete with a drawbridge which he dubbed “Abbadia Mare.” Built between 1926 and 1929 on a steep hill overlooking the Atlantic ocean in Gloucester, Massachusetts, the house features a renaissance dining room, round library, a War room, secret passageways and even an indoor pool with a “weather control” systemthat Hammond could set whenever he felt like swimming in the rain. The house was an expression of all things that Hammond loved, and his behavior showed it. A joyous Hammond was known to leap cannonball style from a second story window into his courtyard pool.A garden room in the courtyard was pieced together from buildings Hammond found and liked while on his travels, in this case a meat market and wine merchant’s house, while in another location an ancient church archway of carved lava from Mt. Vesusvius stands overhead. Also displayed in the museum is the skull of, supposedly, a sailor who sailed with Christopher Columbus. Perhaps the most impressive part of the house is the Great Hall, with its 8200 pipe, eight story high, pipe organ and giant stained glass window. Today the museum showcases Hammond’s fabulous collection of antiques as well as his inventions within the house, along with some cheesier additions as well.One even gets to come face to face – and face to other parts – with Hammond himself.

       "  'In the far southwest corner of Sweden, in a nature preserve a few kilometers northwest of the town of Arild, on a rocky beach reachable only via boat or a strenuous 30- to 45-minute hike, is the nation of Ladonia. You will know when you are in the nation Ladonia, because it is marked by two monumental creative works: Nimis and Arx.Created by artist Lars Vilks, Nimis (Latin for “too much”) is a maze-like wooden artwork made of 70 tons of driftwood and nails and culminating in a teetering, nine-story wooden tower. Arx (Latin for “fortress”) is a stone and concrete sculpture resembling a melting sand castle. Nimis, the first of the two sculptures was begun in 1980 and went unnoticed by authorities for 2 years until 1982, when they declared it would have to be destroyed.As a means of outmaneuvering the Swedish authorities, even while Nimis was scheduled for destruction, Lars sold it to the artist Cristo. The legal document of the sale is a piece of driftwood, once a piece of the artwork itself, on display at the Swedish Museum of Sketches.Another means of avoiding government interference (or perhaps tauntingly inviting it) was for Vilks to declare the area an independent nation. The nation of Ladonia, occupying essentially only the area around the sculptures, was declared in 1996 and has already had its share of national incidents. War was declared on Ladonia by the satirical “Armed Coalition Forces of the Internets.” Ladonia also claims a “population” of over 15,000, though no one resides on the site as “all of its citizens are nomads.”Unfortunately, this was not entirely clear in the online application form, and some 3000 Pakistanis, confused by the micro-nation’s website, applied for immigrant status. They were granted it, as anyone who applies is given citizenship. However, as the Pakistanis began asking about Ladonia’s embassy and the details of how to get there, it became clear that actually moving to Ladonia was not a possibility.',\n",

       "  'The largest Medieval manuscript in the world is believed to have been the work of a single monk in Bohemia (in modern Czechia). Nevertheless, it’s not its 620 pages at three-feet in size that makes it remarkable; it’s the Devil contained therein.Literally meaning “giant book,” the Codex Gigas was created in the 13th century and originally stored in the Benedictine monastery at Podlažice. The manuscript contains not only the New and Old Testaments but also an assortment of other shorter texts addressing matters of extreme practicality for the time: exorcism, grammar, a calendar, and medical works, to name a few.Everything within the book was handwritten by a single, anonymous monk. The National Library of Sweden puts this massive undertaking into perspective:“If the scribe worked for six hours a day and wrote six days a week this means that the manuscript could have taken about five years to complete. If the scribe was a monk he may only have been able to work for about three hours a day, and this means that the manuscript could have taken ten years to write. As the scribe may also have ruled the lines to guide the writing before he began to write (it probably took several hours to rule one leaf), this extends the period it took to complete the manuscript. The scribe also decorated the manuscript, so this all means that the manuscript probably took at least 20 years to finish, and could even have taken 30.”These elements alone are enough to qualify the stunning manuscript as a wonder of the world. Yet the most bewitching element of the Codex Gigas is a single page of illumination that defies explanation, tucked away within the tome. Spanning nearly the entire face of a page is a full-color rendering of the Dark Lord himself.Speculation, plausible and otherwise, abounds as to how the unholiest feature possible made its way into this most sacred text, but answers remain elusive. Precisely because of this tension, everyone loves the Codex Gigas – or, the Devil’s Bible, if you prefer.The manuscriptoriginally travelledto Stockholm in the late 16th century, plundered from the Holy Roman Emperor’s castle by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years War.Thismassive tome currently resides behind glass in a room on the second floor of the King’s Library (also called the National Library of Sweden) in Humlegården (“Humle” meaning “hops,” suggesting royalty grew hops there for their own beer, “gården” meaning “courtyard”), a lovely park in the posh Stockholm neighborhood of Östermalm. The manuscript is not kept open and it is kept in a fairly dark room because of possible damage from light.

We may be waiting a long time.The last direct male descendent of the Stuart Kings died in 1807, so it doesn’t look like the “Steekit Yetts” (that’s Scots for “stuck gates”) will be unstuck any time soon.All entrants to the fortified 12th-century house, from tourists visiting its microbrewery to the current 21st Laird (Lord) of Traquair, have to use the side entrance.Many great houses and castles in Europe are approached by an impressive tree-lined driveway. The Traquair House had such a feature until the bear-topped gates at the end of the driveway were closed indefinitely behind “Bonnie Prince Charlie” Stuart as he rode away in 1745 to restore the Stuart Dynasty to the throne. This lead to the Bear Gates being given the nickname of “The Steekit Yetts.”The house has been owned by relatives of the Stuart Royal Dynasty—a dynasty including Mary Queen of Scots and her son, James VI, who became the first king to hold the throne of both Scotland and England— since the 15th century.James VI’s great-grandson, James VII & II, was the last king of this dynasty. He was exiled from Britain for being Catholic and replaced by an imported Protestant king. Fearful of Catholic superpowers in mainland Europe, the English Parliament then passed laws to prevent any Catholics taking the English throne ever again.This did not stop the exiled king’s grandson, Bonnie Prince Charlie. Charlie, who had grown up in Rome, landed on Eriskay (an island in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides) in 1745 and raised an army of clansmen who were sympathetic to his cause. They marched south through the recently createdUnited Kingdom to attempt to retake the throne.It was during this advance that Bonnie Prince Charlie visited his distant cousin and staunch supporter, the 5th Earl at Traquair (also named Charles Stuart). It was this earl who ordered the gates at the top of the avenue to be shut after him until the Stuarts returned to the throne.Unfortunately for the inhabitants of Traquair, Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Highland Army were defeated in the Battle of Culloden mere months later, and, though he escaped back to mainland Europe with his life, his dynasty never returned.',\n",

A cousin to the Astors and aunt to Edith Wharton, she occupied a space in the upper echelons of New York high society that matched her considerable frame. In 1853 she had built for herself a grandiose gothic mansion in the sleepy hamlet of Rhinecliff, a hundred miles up the Hudson River.Designed by architect George Veitch with 24 rooms, the mansion was topped with a steeple towering over 80 acres of spectacular river views. Wyndcliffe was so magnificent and imposing it inspired a fashion among her similarly wealthy contemporaries to build their own palatialmansions along the Hudson Valley. But Elizabeth’s was the first and the grandest, and is thought to be the inspiration for the phrase “to keep up with the Joneses.”So overbearing was Jones’ gothic fairytale castle in the woods overlooking the Hudson that it terrified her famous niece.In her autobiography,A Backward Glance, Edith Wharton wrote in 1933 of visiting her aunt at Wyndcliffe, as though it were a bit of a horror story, even comparing the imposing exterior with her aunt’s imperious disposition.Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones never married, and after her death, the mansion’s later owners fell foul of the Great Depression, until in 1950, the house was abandoned for good. Today Wyndcliffe lies hidden in the thick forests of the Hudson river valley.Approaching through the forest. the first thing intrepid explorers will see rising out of the pine trees is the old turret. Like a latter day Manderlay, the house which inspired a generation of property tycoons, lies in crumbling ruins.Whole floors have collapsed leaving staircases hanging in mid-air. Half way up the walls, ornate wooden paneling covers arched doorways which once led to further rooms behind. The grand semi-circular dining room wing has all but disappeared. The surrounding 80-acres which once featured outdoor tennis courts where the players could enjoy cold beer piped directly from the house, has been reduced to two, and the sweeping river views have gone.Today, this imposing manse of a once formidable Victorian matriach is slowly disappearing, brick by fallen brick. Visit it soon, because before too long, it will be hard to imagine that anyone ever lived there at all. The only thing keeping up with the Joneses today is the surrounding forest that is slowly and steadily reclaiming what was once the grandest mansion in the state of New York.',\n",

       "  'Section 15 of the Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania, is just off the aptly named walking path, Lazarus Avenue. Lot 41 in this section features an unmarked stone with the top tilted downward, abraded by time and general indifference. The body of one of America’s first serial killers rests 10 feet down, entombed in cement.Herman Webster Mudgett paid his way through the University of Michigan by defrauding insurance companies with cadavers from the school’s Department of Medicine and Surgery. After he graduated in 1884 he changed his name to H.H. Holmes, an homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s fictional detective, and made his way to Chicago.He worked at a drugstore, and after the owner died Holmes conned his widow into handing over the place. Eventually, using the drugstore as a front, he obtained enough money to buy the property across the street. He drew up plans for what became known as his Murder Castle.He finished the building in 1892, just as the Columbian Exposition world’s fair was getting ready nearby. The first floor was separated into storefronts, including the migrated drugstore, the third floor was sectioned into apartments, and the second floor contained soundproof rooms and a chute that went down to a crematorium in the basement.After Holmes fled Chicago in ‘93, he killed Benjamin Pitezel in another insurance scam. A detective, Frank Geyer, was simply looking into the fraudulent claims when it soon became apparent Holmes had killed Pitezel. Geyer’s findings led him to the bodies of Pitezel’s three children and eventually to the Murder Castle, sealing Holmes’ fate.On May 7, 1896, Dr. Henry Howard Holmes was hanged to death for six counts of attempted murder and four counts of first-degree murder. He requested the extra deep cement burial to prevent any potential grave robbers or medical examinations, and rumors have persisted that this was a way to avoid anyone discovering the body isn’t actually his.He was smart, charming, and handsome, and he preyed on young women, many of whom had just left home for the first time. There are claims he killed as few as nine and as many as 200 people. In prison he penned the book Holmes’ Own Story, which contends he was wrongfully accused of 22 murders. Newspapers paid him $7,500 for his confession of killing 27 people, but it was filled with contradictions and he recanted it on the gallows anyway. It did include one haunting admission: “I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.”',\n",

       "  'These Spanish cloisters built in Spain between 1133-1141 AD almost never made it to their current home in Miami, Florida to gain fame as the oldest built structure in the Western Hemisphere. For 700 years, the cloisters were part of a Cistercian monastery. In the mid-1830s, the First Carlist War in Spain led to the seizure of the cloisters, which were then sold and turned into a granary.Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 for 5 million dollars, but it wasn’t until much later that the Cloisters made it to Florida.William Randolph Hearst took an interest in the Cloisters and decided it would make a nice addition to the United States. In 1925 he bought the cloisters, which were taken apart stone by stone and shipped to the U.S. in 11,000 separate, numbered boxes. Perhaps he wanted to add them to Hearst Castle, his mansion in California. Unfortunately for Mr. Hearst, the cloister stones had been shipped with hay that was possibly contaminated with Hoof-and-Mouth Disease, which had just broken out in Spain. The boxes were quarantined and emptied, the hay was burned, and the stones were returned randomly to the boxes. This was only the beginning of Heart’s problems, however, as his dire financial situation soon forced him to sell most of his belongings. The cloisters remained in boxes in a warehouse in Brooklyn until Hearst’s death in 1952.The boxes were purchased by Mr. W. Edgemon and Mr. R. Moss for $1.5 million. They had the idea to reconstruct the cloisters as a tourist attraction. After 19 months of puzzling over how the blocks fit together, they succeeded.',\n",

       "  'Aerospace and entertainment are familiar bedfellows.One of the few places in Tinsel Town that can bridge this magical coupling is Global Effects, Inc, a multi-faceted prop and effects house that, among other things, specializes in the final frontier.Like most fascinating places in the film industry, Global Effects hides its warehouse of secrets in an unassuming brick building in Sylmar, completely un-extraordinary to the untrained eye. But inside, the doors open up to a treasure trove of movie magic, including monsters, snakes in jars, rows and rows of grisly medieval arms, and shelves full of the clutter one might stumble over in any castle, witch cave, or torture dungeon. Costumes ranging in genre, time period, and realism hang neatly on racks, but perhaps the most intriguing and eye-catching collection to marvel over is what is considered Global’s shining star – their space suits.The suits are so realistic that NASA is one of Global’s biggest customers. Suits that have actually made the amazing journey out of the atmosphere and into the beyond rarely come home in decent shape, if they come home at all. When Buzz Aldrin is dressed in his astronaut best for photo shoots and dedication ceremonies, he is wearing a replica space suit – the real deal costs more than any production could possibly afford, and can weigh up to 3 times what a Global replica does.Serving as the go-to for countless film, TV and commercial productions for spacesuit rentals, Global Effects also supplies museums and displays all over the world. NASA rents the suits and hires Global technicians to handle them whenever a former moonwalker dons one for a magazine shoot or an appearance. A complicated operation despite their being facsimiles, the suits are multi-layered with authentic locking rings, lights and ventilation systems. Some even require the wearer to climb scaffolding and slip into the suits through a hatch in the back. The suits are considered lightweight at 75-80 lb., and at somewhere around $2000 a week they are attainable and convenient for film productions and NASA productions alike.NASA was so impressed with Global’s replicas that they challenged the owner Chris Gilman and partner Denis Gilliam to design a real suit for them. The result of this was a manufactured prototype EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) spacesuit.With the privatization of the space industry, it doesn’t seem like such a leap to think that the master replicators of the most authentic fakes in Hollywood could someday be designing the real thing.',\n",

       "  'From Providence to East Providence, Rhode Island spans a bridge with a Facebook page. The Crook Point Bridge waits like a sentry, quietly watching over the Seekonk River, for someone to lower her down.The bridge is a “bascule” bridge – a “drawbridge” in more common terms – and has been left in its “stuck-up” position since being abandoned in 1976. The bridge was built in 1908 as part of the East Side Railroad Tunnel project, as a way to connect the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines to Union Station. It saw a lot of activity, both in terms of train traffic above and river traffic below, until the mid-1970s when train travel began to fall off. Keeping the Crook Point Bridge up (and down) and running was costly, and the reduced train use couldn’t make it pay off. So rather than dismantle the bridge, they simply pulled up the draw, and left it that way. For nearly 40 years it has both vexed and inspired Rhode Islanders and chroniclers of its ghostly beauty. This particular bascule bridge is a Scherzer Rolling Lift bridge, named for the company that invented the technology that operates it. Think of it like a rocking chair – the end of the section that lifts (the leaf) is curved like the runners of a rocking chair, and rather than putting the leaf on heavy hinges, you simply “rock” the curvature back, and that raises the leaf. Pretty ingenious.Oddly enough, many residents of Providence and East Providence, while maybe not exactly proud of their Stuck Up Bridge, do seem to have a kind of sentimental attachment to it. Drawbridges have always had a particular kind of charisma – as far back as castles with moats and drawbridges, or as kids watching them rise and seeing ships travel underneath, and one of the most famous bascules of them all, London Tower Bridge, has inspired historians, artists and writers for well over a hundred years. Crook Point Bridge has provided its share of inspiration too, for graffiti artists, Rhode Island School of Design projects, and amateur as well as professional photographers. With no development plans in the near future, it’s anyone’s guess if and when the bridge will come down.',\n",

       "  'Strolling through the countryside of Scotland you expect to see the ruins of an ancient castle or two - the hillsides are full of them. However, tucked away in the woods outside Cardross lies an entirely different kind of relic.The ruins of St. Peter’s Seminary are seemingly not of this world. It’s as though you’ve stumbled upon the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. In appearance the word “brutal” is an understatement. Daunting, ghastly, decimated are all appropriate descriptors.Alien as they may appear, St. Peter’s function was quite quotidian, and as far as ruins are concerned, they are not very old.Designed in 1958 by Gillespie, Kidd, and Coia, it’s an A-listed building that sits on several preservation lists for being an excellent example of Scottish modern design. So, what brought this spiritual hall of learning to such a sorry state?By the time St. Peter’s Seminary was completed in 1966, its function was obsolete. The Roman Catholic Church had recently decided that priests should train in communities rather than the isolation of remote seminary colleges. To compound problems, church attendance in Scotland was declining, as well as the number of young men wishing to enter the priesthood. This left St. Peter’s, a school designed to house and train a hundred would-be priests, with a residency of only twenty-some students by the late seventies. In 1980 St. Peter’s permanently closed its doors.Since then, neglect, the elements, a sizable fire, and nearly daily vandalism have taken their toll, reducing the seminary to a hulking skeleton.Update as of November 2016:Demolition work has sadly begun and the seminary has been securely fenced off with very limited access. However, if you are wearing suitable clothing and are stealthy enough to avoid guards that occasionally check the site, it is well worth the effort.Update as of April 2018: The building is being conserved by NVA who have organized walking tours and there are plans for it to be developed into an arts venue and visitor attraction.Update as of October 2019: The NVA closed down in June 2018 and responsibility ofthe building returned to the Catholic archdiocese. Being A-Listed, the church is unable to be demolished, and for now, will remain as ruins.',\n",

Today, it continues to serve as one of the grandest places to grab a beer in the whole country.Built in the 1890s by European beer brewer Christian Heurich, the gothic edifice was made to be the brewer’s grand palace. Heurich came to the states in 1866, but had been brewing beer since childhood, learning the art from his father. When he arrived in the U.S., Heurich threw himself into building a beer brewing empire. He created a massive fireproof brewery, where the Kennedy Center stands today, that could pump out over 500,000 barrels a year, becoming the second largest employer in D.C., eclipsed only by the government itself.Using the wealth from his massive brewing business, Heurich built his grand home with his second wife. The home was inspired by the elaborate Victorian trends of the late 1800s, featuring stone arches and a tall tower rising above the rest of the three story house on one side. Heurich lived in the elaborate home until his death in 1945 at the age of 102.The Christian Heurich Brewing Company closed down just over a decade later and was demolished in 1962.Heurich’s home, however, has had a second act as a national historic landmark. The first two floors have been preserved, and the spirit of the brewing business that led to the construction of the house is preserved as well. Regular beer events are held in the space like Oktoberfests anda monthly beer tasting called “History and Hops,” where visitors can have a beer while taking tours of the available space in the house.

The story tells of Asano Naganori, a feudal lord in 18th century Japan, who was forced to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) after he attackedKira Yoshinaka, a high-ranking master of ceremonies. Naganori’s death left the samurai under his auspice without a master, and 47 of them felt honor-bound to take revenge.Newly ronin-ized, the 47 warriors disappeared into lives of drunkenness and vice for over a year, although according to the legend, this was all part of the plan. In December of 1703, the 47 Ronin pulled themselves out of their seeming stupor, and launched a surprise attack on Yoshinaka’s castle. They successfully killed Yoshinaka, avenging their master. However true to their code they then turned themselves into the authorities, who then asked each of them to commit seppuku. The 47 Ronin took their own lives, upholding the sacred Bushido code.Based on actual events, the story has become so ingrained as a national legend that exact fact and fiction are not immediately easy to separate. Nonetheless,Naganori and his 47 Loyal Retainers, or the men the legend is based on, are buried at the 17th century Buddhist temple, Sengaku-Ji.The temple is still a popular destination for visitors looking to pay tribute to real-life legends.',\n",

TheNautilus Foundation was his retirement plan: an architecturally superior retreat for him and his fellow intellectuals to have a smoke and share ideas, far from the trappings of the rest of the world. Hedescribed his cerebral refuge with hope-filled excitement.“We have created a kind of think tank, a place to promote creative thinking of ways to build a better world.”Born in 1927 in Switzerland, Bucher never losttheslightly lilting Swiss accent, carrying it throughout his career at numerous universities. Amedieval art expert and architecture professor, Bucher taught atYale, Princeton, University of Minnesota and finally, in his later years, situated himself at Florida State University. It was here, inspired by the work of Buckminster Fuller and Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, that he began creatingNautilus.Bucher began building the Nautilus Foundation in his mid-50s. His concept an illustration of his esoteric inner world made physical. Built out of cinder block, it had living quarters, a lecture hall, a library, and an art gallery. A student who lived there described it as “a modern art castle in the North Florida woods.” She elaborated, listing thecastle’s contents asan enchantingly absurd list of items.“Gauguin’s ladies. Ancient books. Skin puppets in an old trunk. A secret passageway. A ghost ship. Michelangelo’s cold brained boy. A phone call from Nelson Mandela. A monster from my childhood. Einstein’s couch. Avenging angels. Pick-up truck angels. A nun’s room. A locked tower. Zillions and zillions of stars. A Minotaur.”Nautilus never quite reached his vision of the elaborate creative think tank Bucherenvisioned. In his mind’s eye it would include a Quadrivium building, meant to contain design studios and study rooms and flanked by a dormitory. The lofty project was never fully completed, and what hasn’t been re-purposed is now abandoned.Bucher lived out the last years of his life at theNautilus Foundation, largely alone.After his death, the property was deeded to the Collins Institute for Public Policy.

       "  'The story of the Luisenburg rock labyrinth in Wunsiedel, Germany starts 240 million years ago, when lava flowed into the mountainous area. After the lava solidified and crystalized, erosion began to slowly break down the softer rocks and round off the hard granite leaving the boggy, woodland area strewn with formations of giant rocks and boulders, caves and plateaus.Fast forward to 1790 when the landscaping craze of the early romanticism swept across Europe and the good people of Wunsiedel began draining the area, laying down paths and carving out stairs, slowly turning the boggy and rock filled forest into a romantic wonderland inspired by English gardens.The labyrinth project was funded by a regular visitor to the area’s baths, Baron von Carlowitz from Regensburg, who also penned several of the rock inscriptions.This first part of the maze ended by the ruined castle and one-time robbers’ den called Luxburg, whichhad been crumbling away amongst the rocks and boulders since at least 1352. In dramatic style, the ending of the labyrinthwas marked with the words “This Far and no Further” carved into the rock.In 1805, Frederick William III of Prussia came to visit the area for the first time since its annexation to the Prussian Crown and the mayor of nearby Wunsiedel Dr. Johann Georg Schmidt renamed Luxburg and surrounding area “Luisenburg” to honorthe PrussianQueen Louise. On this occasion, the mayoralso initiated the expansion of the maze, however it was temporarily halted by the Napoleonic occupation between 1806 and 1810.After the war, three of Schmidt’s sons, including Florentin Theodor Schmidt, who made his fortune trading in sugar, picked up the work of expanding the labyrinth. (Todayseveral rocks at Luisenburg bear the inscription FTS.)Luisenburg was completed in 1820, featuring paths, benches for resting, numerous poetic inscriptions in the granite rocks, and an open air theatre. Rock formations were given enticing names like The Three Brothers, Napoleon’s Hat, Sugar Loaf, and Devil’s Staircase.The open air theatre has been expanded and modernized on several occasions and to this day hosts outdoor plays in the summer season.Allegedly, these plays predate the rock maze—the first plays are said to have been staged at the natural cave theatre by the entrance as early as 1665 as part of the Margarethenfest, thus making the Luisenburg Festspiele the oldest existing outdoor theatre in Germany.The labyrinthgets more difficult to navigate as you progress. In the beginning the paths are wide, you can make little detours to explore vantage points and small caves, some of which are covered in a luminous moss. But as you get nearer to the climax of the maze you have to squeeze through narrow passages, climb steep, wet stairs and the ground can be soggy. Once you reach the end, you are led back out along other paths and walking gets easier as you’ve finished your adventure. Your return to civilization is tranquil affair: One of the first inscribed rocks you encounter on your way back bear the words “Ego in Arcadia — I am in Utopia.”On your way towards the exit, you come across a seven-meter tall rock sat in a small pond. It’s known as Insel Helgoland, named after the North Sea island of Heligoland.The islandheld a particular place in Schmidt’s heart. As it was under English rule, the English used Heligoland as a harbor for smuggling sugar ,and thus made trading sugar with Germany possible despite a trade blockade imposed by Napoleon.The monolithis crowned by a wooden pagoda—the current one is a replica built in 2005 as part of a large scale renovation of the park marking the bicentenary of Queen Louise’s visit.',\n",

The fairy queenhas constructed her castle along the ridge top and many of her subjects have followed suit, building homes in the trees and bushes along the trail.Originally, the enchanting abodes were part of the Aliso Summit Trail, but they were later moved to their current location. There are at least a dozen tiny fairy houses dotting the vista-filled hike, which began materializingmysteriously starting in 2016. The fairies have chosen bright multicolored doors for their little homes and some have decorated their gardens with statues and furniture. They have even built a variety of communal buildings, including a cricket auditorium, playground, and bonfire circle. More recently, some trolls have started to move in, and the fairies ask that visitors not feed them. Rather shy, the fairies sleep during the day, coming out only at dusk when the trail closes to the human public. But a variety of Southern California wildlife can normally be seen along the trail even if the fairies themselves are shut in their homes.Aliso Canyon is home to Aliso Creek, one of the last few watercourses in Orange County that is not divided into channels.Despite the impact of urban development in its watershed, the creek retains some biodiversity and supports wildlife in protected environments. The fairy homes have a great view of the creek and the narrow gorge where it reaches the Pacific Ocean.Update, May 2018: The fairy homes were originally part of the Aliso Summit Trail.

Born “Daryl Sattui,” Dario had little interest in wine as a young adult. His grandfather, V. Sattui (after whom Dario’s original winery is named), moved to the United States in 1885 and opened a winery in San Francisco. However, when his business failed during the height of Prohibition, V. Sattui turned to selling insurance, and the winery was forgotten.In the mid 1970s, after attending college and traveling abroad, Dario Sattui returned to California intent on reviving his family’s wine-making traditions. After a rough start, his V. Sattui winery has grown to become one of the most profitable operations in the entire wine country region.In the early 1990s, Dario’s fascination with Old World Italian architecture led him to draw up plans for a new 8,500 square foot Medieval-style building without cellars - plans that quickly evolved into the building that stands today. Construction started in 1995, and the building opened to the public in April, 2007, twelve years and millions of dollars later.Dario was exhaustive in his quest for authenticity. Over one million antique bricks from torn down Hapsburg palaces were shipped to him and re-purposed. One family in Italy, the Marianis, crafted every nail, hinge, lock, and chain link over an open forge. No expense, in either time or effort, was spared making Dario’s dream of owning an authentic Italian castle in the Northern California wine country a reality. The site even features a replica torture chamber with a 300-year-old iron maiden.To some, Dario Sattui’s wine-making fortress is a monstrosity. To others, it is an artifact of the old country that reflects wine’s ancient European roots. But everyone can agree that the Castello di Amorosa, its grey stone walls sharply contrasted with row upon row of crimson, green, and burnished bronze grape vines, is impressive in scope, authentic in detail, and utterly unique.',\n",

The closedrunwaywas at one time used as a training area for Disney’s bus drivers, which revealed a hidden surprise for the trainees. Originally used to surprise the airplane passengers, the set of grooves, like those on the side of a highway, that line this runway play “When you wish upon a star” when driven over at roughly 45 miles per hour.Curiously, even if a plane desired to land on this musical runway it would be unable to do so, for multiple reasons. In the late 1970s the elevated monorail was extendednear the end of the runway, making landing a plane there much too dangerous. Even Disney’s official plane “Mickey Mouse One” was forced to land on “World Drive” rather than Disney’s own abandoned runway.There is yet another, even stranger, reason that planes are not allowed to land here. After 9/11, Disney was given its own protected airspace and no-fly zone known asTFR 9/4985. So at lower altitudes, like those necessary to take off and land, Cinderella’s castle has the same airspace protections as the White House. Florida’s pilots are all very familiar (and annoyed) with the zone and give the parks a wide berth. (Recently Disney has applied to be able to fly its own drones within the zone, angering pilots who felt Disney never should have gotten the protection in the first place.)Despite the many reasons that no planes will ever again land on theLake Buena Vista STOLPort, the Magic Kingdom’s musical runway remains, waiting to “wish upon a star” with you.Update: Though the airstrip itself still exists, the set of musical grooves was removed in 2008 and can no longer be experienced.',\n",

These places are often the domain of society’s marginalized, places where the homeless, bored teenagers, and those who simply wish to play and create without oversight can congregate.The Albany Bulb (aka The Bulb) is one of these places. If you asked the city officials, they would tell you it is a landfill located on a thin strip of wetland in Albany, California, which extends into the southeast San Francisco Bay. If you asked the people who frequent it, you would get a different answer altogether.Created in 1963 as a dump for construction materials, it was closed in 1987 after a series of lawsuits and left in legal limbo. The size and inaccessibility of the park made it difficult for the police to patrol – and a perfect location for those looking not to be patrolled. Due to this, the Bulb has a reputation as an anarchic no-mans land, especially at night.Among those who have claimed the park are the homeless, who have set up small shantytowns; teenagers, who want a place to party; dog owners, who want to let their pets run wild; graffiti artists, who want to paint in peace; and environmentalists, who want to see the park returned to its natural habitat, and resent the dog-walkers and graffiti artists for helping to ruin the habitat.However, the Bulb is most distinctive for the contributions of its artists, both graffiti and sculptural, to the park. Among the more notable pieces are a series of large driftwood sculptures made by Scott Hewitt, Scott Meadows and David Ryan; a concrete TV; dragon sculpture; and something known as “The Castle”, which is a eroding concrete shelter covered in graffiti.The Bulb once contained amakeshift “Landfillian Library” assembled by Jimbow the Hobow. Comprised of roughly 300 books donated to “head librarian” Jimbow, the books werenot only free to borrow, but free to keep. According to Wikipedia, the library burned to the ground in January 2014.The future of the Bulb is uncertain, with possible plans to turn it into an official park, or shopping area. In the meantime, the Bulb continues to operate under its own unplanned plans.',\n",

       "  'DANK Haus Chicago has served as the city’s German-American Cultural Center since 1967. From its location in the historically German neighborhood of Lincoln Square, DANK (which stands for Deutsch Amerikanischer National Kongress, or German American National Congress) hosts hundreds of German-focused classes, exhibits, and events throughout the year that pay homage to Chicago’s rich history of German settlement.Step inside today and you’ll find many of the building’s most interesting quirks beautifully maintained, like its traditional ballroom, former cafeteria space with German family crests, rooftop terrace, and more. The building, which well-known Chicago architect Paul Gerhardt originally built for the Three Links Association, once housed an upscale men’s social club. The old swimming pool, now unused, even remains in the basement.As Chicago’s German immigrant populations homogenized within the city, shrinking heritage clubs and societies began to congregate and call the DANK Haus home. Today, in addition to the cultural center’s own programming, numerous small groups meet weekly to watch German-language films, socialize, eat, and even practice their sharpshooting.Perhaps the most interesting of these groups is the Schlaraffia Club, a medieval-inspired men’s humor society whose Chicago chapter meets seasonally inside the DANK Haus. The members have been given a small, single-purpose room within the building that they’ve decorated lavishly in iconic blood-red castle decor. Due to the extensive, ritualistic initiation process and strict qualifying requirements (members must be men fluent in an antiquated dialect of German), the chapter has dwindled to just a few elderly men (though they are actively recruiting).Whether you’re visiting Chicago for the first time or live locally, the plethora of offerings at the DANK Haus makes it a perfect, low-cost way to learn about German heritage in the city and beyond.',\n",

       "  'The Edinburgh Maiden',\n",
       "  'Until the late 16thcentury, the traditional method of execution in Edinburgh was beheading by means of a sword. When the official sword had essentially worn out, authorities were even reduced to renting a suitable blade when needed.This prompted the construction of a beheading device that became known as the Maiden (rumor has it the name came from the long period between its construction and its first use). Ironically, the man who is believed responsible for its introduction, James Douglas, fourth Earl of Morton, was executed by the Maiden in 1581. The device was designed so that it could be disassembled and transported to where it might be used—a sort of flat-pack for an implement of execution. It has been documented that it was used on the Edinburgh Castle Esplanade, the Grassmarket, and south of St. Giles, on the Royal Mile near the Mercat Cross.It’s said that Douglas based the concept for his design on another decapitation device: the Halifax Gibbet. However there are some important differences between the two. First off, the Maiden’s blade was driven downward by a massive lead weight, rather than a large wooden block. Secondly, the Maiden required the victim to stand and bend over, with the block for the neck about four feet from the floor, rather than laying prone. Arriving in this position was commonly referred to as “Kissing the Maiden.”After the last execution in 1716, the Maiden was put into storage for years. When it was rediscovered, it was put on display at the Edinburgh Museum of Antiquities, which is now the National Museum of Scotland. Unlike the Halifax Gibbet, which is only available as a replica, this exhibit is the real thing.',\n",

       "  'One of the country’s oldest fast-food burger chains, Kewpee Hamburgers, once had hundreds of restaurants throughout the Midwest – and their crazy square burgers maybe helped inspire one Kewpee lover to start his own chain.Founded in 1923 in Flint, Michigan and originally called Kewpee Hotels Hamburgs (only A&W and White Castle can claim to be older), the Kewpee Hamburger chain was named after the “Kewpie” characters created by the artist, writer, and cartoonist Rose O’Neill. Starting in 1909, O’Neill’s little cherubs (named Kewpies because they resembled little Cupids) became so popular in the funny papers that they spawned what amounted to early merchandising – Kewpie dolls, made famous first as paper dolls and eventually as prizes at fairs and carnivals. The little guy (girl?) also became the mascot of Kewpee Hamburgers, cherubically standing watch over the front of each shop.With their square patties and super-thick shakes, Kewpee’s grew from just a few shops in the 1920s to nearly 400 during the early 1940s. Spreading across the Midwest from its first home in Flint, Michigan, people loved the food and cute mascot alike. But during World War II, beef became harder and harder to come by, and most of those shops closed their doors. Along the way they had instituted some of the very first curb-side delivery, an early version of the drive-in that eventually morphed into the drive-thru.The story of Kewpee’s also includes one tale (maybe apocryphal) about a much younger burger chain started by Dave Thomas in 1969 in Columbus, Ohio. Kewpee fans say that Dave grew up near a Kewpee’s and was so in love with those square burgers and malted shakes that he decided to start his own restaurant chain. If true, little Wendy’s dad maybe owes some success to that Midwestern cherub.But true or not, give that girl a Kewpie Doll!',\n",

       "  'The history of the ninja is closely associated with Mie Prefecture in southern Japan, where a small museum is dedicated to their history and art. Located close to Iga Ueno Castle, the museum celebrates ninja stealth and skill through artifacts, secret passages and traps doors, and hands-on demonstrations.The history of the ninja is clouded in centuries of mythology, but they seem to have become established during the medieval Sengoku or Warring States period of political unrest, which began in the mid-15th century.Somewhere between a spy and a mercenary, ninja (the word is both singular and plural) used specialized skills to gather covert information and perform assassinations on behalf of feudal lords. Ninja were in many ways the opposite of samurai, who fought openly and lived highly structured lives centered around rituals. Coming from the lowest, most “invisible” social classes, ninja developed their own methods of secrecy, misdirection, and espionage. “Ninjitsu” describes both the physical skills of espionage and survival, as well as the ninja philosophy.The museum is divided into sections devoted to different elements of ninja lore and history. The Ninja House is a model home full of trap doors, hidden stairs, and concealed escape routes. Other areas feature demonstrations of skill and exhibits of ninja miscellany such as shuriken (throwing stars), swords, secret codes, and, of course, a ninja gift shop.',\n",

       "  'The Woolworth Building',\n",
       "  'Frank Winfield Woolworth five-and-dimed his way to the top of the world, and he did it in style.When the Woolworth Building opened in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson pressed a button in the White House, and 80,000 light bulbs flashed to life on Broadway as Thomas Edison supervised. Then Edison joined a banquet for 900 other prominent guests that the New-York Tribune called “the highest dinner ever held in New York.” During the ceremonies, famed radio pastor Samuel Parkes Cadman made “cathedral of commerce” the skyscraper’s nickname for the ages.Over 100 years later, much of the original glory remains, though the general public wouldn’t know it. Master architect Cass Gilbert’s Gothic gem still gleams in lower Manhattan, but few tourists have been inside in recent years. The building’s owners for the past couple of decades closed it to casual visitors. Post-9/11 security restrictions didn’t help, either. But that’s starting to change.Thanks to the efforts of Gilbert’s great-granddaughter, Helen Post-Curry, the owners allowed private tours in 2013 for the building’s centennial celebration. A great response led to regular paid tours. The tours focus almost entirely on the lobby—in addition to the aforementioned unfortunate closures, the 57th-floor observation deck was shut down during World War II out of fear that enemy spies could exploit its harbor views—but the lobby contains plenty to illuminate the Woolworth’s soaring story.One need only look up at the grand Heinigke & Bowen stained-glass ceiling over the main stairs to grasp F.W. Woolworth’s animating vision. Border panels devoted to great empire-builders like Spain and Russia lie alongside others featuring the Woolworth “W” as well as 1913 for the building opening and 1879 for the opening of the first successful “Woolworth’s Great Five Cent Store” in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (a store in Utica, New York, failed in 1878, and Woolworth reused its sign in Lancaster).By 1910, the operation was humming along well enough for Woolworth to lay plans for a company headquarters that would be the tallest building in the world, surpassing the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Insurance skyscraper completed in 1909. Woolworth scrapped a more modest $5 million estimate, and the final bill of $13.5 million produced the 792-foot (and one inch) finished structure of 58 stories (or 80 conventional stories, since ceilings range from 11 to 20 feet). The retail baron paid for it all in cash—perhaps in nickels and dimes only, as some say, and perhaps not.It’s also said that Woolworth spared no expense on the construction. Yet despite the gaudy price tag, he couldn’t resist a bit of skimping (amusingly enough, Woolworth is counting coins in the lobby gargoyle that portrays him). The Tiffany elevator ornamentation is cast iron done up like brass, terra cotta masquerades as marble on the exterior, and interior marble touted as “Greek” was actually mined in Vermont. Woolworth hired Cass Gilbert to create a world-class, historic company monument, but he always had business in mind.“My idea was purely commercial,” he said in 1910. “I saw possibilities of making this the greatest income producing property in which I could invest my money.”The building’s construction was a media phenomenon, and Woolworth was surely pleased with its critical reception and popularity. Woolworth opened his crown jewel up just like his stores, with counters and eateries alongside plentiful retail outlets. Missteps were minimal, such as the German beer hall shunned by some patriots during World War I, though the war’s drain on construction did benefit the building overall—it remained the world’s tallest until 1930, when the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State Building were completed.The Woolworth Building finally left Woolworth hands in 1998 with a $155 million sale to the Witkoff Group, which launched a plan to turn the top 25 floors of the building tower into 34 luxury apartments. Most were offered for $7 to $10 million, though two listed at $20 million, and one seven-level “Castle in the Sky” penthouse had a city residential record $110 million price tag. The tower residences have a separate lobby and elevators as well as a restored lounge and an underground swimming pool.One wonders what the building’s namesake would think of these investment returns, not to mention the stratification of a tower rooted in mass consumption. Woolworth pursued power and status relentlessly, though, and he enjoyed his lofty position from opulent personal spaces on various floors. These included a Renaissance-style apartment on the 40th floor, private suites on the 25th floor, and a 24th-floor “Empire Room” office inspired by Woolworth’s deep Napoleon obsession. Designers there used Napoleonic palace decor, filled it with memorabilia, and made a replica throne chair to await a man who saw his stores as an empire and his staff as a military hierarchy.Unfortunately enough, Woolworth only reigned from what he called his “imperial capital” for about five years, dying at age 66 in 1919. If he were invited to the “Castle in the Sky,” he might marvel that his building is still breaking records and attracting the elite of a new gilded age. But perhaps he’d also insist on more foot traffic in the lobby.',\n",

R. Hearst’s homegrew into a mansion of epic proportions. He and the architect, Julia Morgan, settled on a vaguely medieval Iberian style, with vaultedceilings and lavishcornices adorned with cherubs. Hearst’s modus operandi was quality over quantity when it came to collecting art, so the rooms were designed in a pastiche of styles and eras to suit the precious sculptures and paintings they held.La Cuesta Encantada (“The Enchanted Hill”) was informally known as “the ranch,” an almost comical understatement of the house’s size. By the time it was finished it contained over 165 rooms and 127 acres of gardens and terraces. There were multiplelibraries, an exotic zoo, tennis courts, numerous guest cottages, stables where Arabian horses were bred, a wine cellar, a medieval-style banquet hall, an airstrip, an indoor pool, and an outdoor pool. The outdoor Neptune Pool was built, then remodeled three times to suit the authentic Roman temple facade Hearst shipped in from Italy. No expense was spared to create the magnate’s paradise: a power plant was even constructed nearby to supply electricity to the remote castle.Hearst lived in the home, hosting lavish parties throughout its construction until his failing health forced him to relocate in 1947, at which time construction ceased. He died in 1951, and in 1958 the palatial estate was designated a California State Park. Little has changed inside the castle since then.Descendants of the zebras and rare deer in the private zoo still roam the grounds. Today, just as then, people are eager to catch a glimpse of how the world’s most notoriousnewspaper magnate lived in glamourwhile the rest of the country suffered the economic devastation of the 1930s.',\n",

Nor, apparently, was any hubris, as the manse was built to resemble the castles of France, with a sprawling formal garden inspired by the famous grounds of Versailles.The mansion’s interior is lavishly decorated with world-class paintings, tapestries, antique furniture, crystal chandeliers, carvings, faux finishes, and coffered ceilings. The 5-floor, 47,000-square-foot house includes a conservatory and music room among its 77 rooms.The gardens, meanwhile, cover a 10-acre expanse. The decadent grounds boast a boxwood garden, a 1-acrereflecting pool, fountains, a colonnade, decorative sculptures, and a Temple of Love, with a sculpture of Diana the Huntress inside. (No idea where he got that idea from, as Diana is not the goddess of love, but the goddess of the hunt.)French sculptor Prosper Lecourtier a specialist in animal figures designed the two elk at the top of the vista. French-born American sculptor Henri Crenier designed the one-acrereflecting pool that holds 157 jets and is the masterpiece of the garden, although not the only water feature.The highlight of the grounds is arguably the Sunken Gardens, which faces the lake and has grottos, numerous fountains, and water gushing down in copious quantities. The showcase of the garden is the gilded Achievement sculpture, presiding over the estate.There are quite a few mansions in Delaware and Pennsylvania that were built by the Du Pont family, which was very powerful in the region. Nemours was named after the French town that the family hailed from.Interestingly, Alfred I. du Pont got into a long dispute over stock shares of the Du Pont gunpowder company with his cousin Pierre du Pont (founder of Longwood Gardens in Philadelphia), and lost the battle for control of the family company. It is rumored that the 10-foot-tall wall embeddedwith broken glass that winds around the estate was built because of the family feud.In his later years, Alfred du Pont gave Nemours to the children’s hospital he establishedin his name and set up a trust for the mansion’s upkeep.',\n",

Pillars, flying buttresses and grottoes carefully crafted of found stones form the 26 meters long and 10 meters high “Palais Idea”.Ferdinand Cheval (1836-1924), a French postman, began work on his dream palace in the late 19th century. As the story is told, Cheval tripped on a rock in 1879 along his mail route, picked it up and was so fascinated by its peculiar shape that he was inspired to build the imaginative palace.Coming from humble beginnings, Cheval had minimal formal education and no architectural experience, however, he was self-educated with help from the Le Magazin Pittoresque. Over the course of 34 years he enduring the criticism and mockery of his neighbors as he continued building. Pushing a wheelbarrow along his expanded mail route of 42km, he collected stones and he completed the building with no outside help. The criticism eventually turned into admiration, and tourists began flocking to Hauterives to see the Palais Idéal.The architecture is inspired by different styles and eras, mingling together Chinese, Algerian and Northern European influences to create a fantastic and completely original castle of grottoes. “You start wondering,” the postman wrote of his palace, “if you have not been carried away into a fantastic dream with boundaries beyond the scope of imagination.” The fantastic dream brought to life in Le Palais Ideal is completed by fanciful statues resembling ostriches, elephants and bears.Cheval wanted to be buried in his palace, and when French authorities forbade it, he spent the next decade constructing his own magnificent vault in the local cemetery at the age of 80. Inscribed in the palace walls is Cheval’s message to the world: “I was not a builder, I had never handled a mason’s trowel, I was not a sculptor. The chisel was unknown to me; not to mention architecture, a field of which I remained totally ignorant… Everything you can see, passer-by, is the work of one peasant, who, out of a dream, created the queen of the world…”',\n",

On a large excavated pond, guests rode the Little Toot tugboat and visited Mount Vesuvius and Jungle Land.After nearly three decades of operation, the park grew to over 52 acres, drawing close to 400,000 visitors each summer during its prime in the late 1970s and early 1980s.Unfortunately, The Enchanted Forest began to face tough competition from the roller coaster theme parks that were being built in the Baltimore area. Enthusiasm for a low-tech park eventually faded and led to an inevitable close in 1989.While the Eastern side of the park was bulldozed to allow room for a shopping mall, the other half remains untouched. Many of the artifacts were moved to Clark’s Elioak Farm, but a few tattered attractions still remain scattered among the brushy undergrowth.Faded cement gingerbread men, which once formed a welcoming border along Route 40, are now clumped together like crooked tombstones.

Unfortunately it did not last very long and the taxidermalogical assemblage, which included a prestigious antler collection, was closed with the onset of World War II. However, undeterred the museum reopened in 1966 inside of the former Augustinerkloster, a defunctAugustinian abbey that had stood in the city since the 13th century. Elk heads were posted at the stations of the cross and the central crucifix was replaced with a piece of taxidermy. Finding more stability and success in the lovely new space, the museum’s collection of animals (and their heads) continued to grow and the scope was expanded to include exhibits related to fishing in the 1980s.However alongsidethe sprawling collection of over 1,000 taxidermy beasts, the star attraction of the museum is the small selection of mammalian-avian monstrosities known as “wolpertingers.” A European cousin to the equally mythic American Jackalope, wolpertingers are rare chimerical creatures said to inhabit the dense Bavarian forests.

The tunnel was built in 1855 as the main access to an exclusive Victorian residential area, though thanks to a mistake, things did not end as planned.In the 19th century, the Duke of Portland, who owned nearby Nottingham Castle, wanted to convert some of his sizeable backyard into an exclusive residential development of palatial dwellings for Nottingham’s burgeoning middle class. To the west of the rapidly industrializing city and known as “The Park,” many impressive residences were constructed in the neighborhood by Nottingham’s competing architectural prodigies, Watson Fothergill and T.C. Hine.The Duke commissioned Hine to excavate a tunnel through the city’s soft and crumbly sandstone substrate, creating a grand and impressive approach to the wealthy new neighborhood from Derby Road, a main city thoroughfare. He specified a maximum incline of 1 in 14 along the tunnel’s length to allow the heavy horse-drawn carriages of the day to pass. Unfortunately, after the project’s completion the incline was found to be 1 in 12, making it too steep for even the strongest horses to haul a carriage, so the tunnel was abandoned.An alternative road entrance was created for The Park, leaving the tunnel to languish forever as a little-used but incredibly grand subterranean footpath accessed by steep Victorian staircases, its crumbly sides held up by high brickwork. Today, after many decades of urban development, this ultimately doomed, yet startlingly grand, infrastructure terminates in the most unlikely manner at a parking lot shared by a convent and office buildings.',\n",

With 3000 men attacking, they laid waste to the survivor of previous centuries of sieges and battles, the scene of many a grisly and cold death. The ruins have stood empty since then, slowly crumbling and providing shelter to local birds – and possibly a ghostly visitor.Overlooking the the Firth of Forth and the Bass Rock, Tantallon was first built in mid-14th century by William Douglas, Earl of Douglas. The nephew of Robert the Bruce’s brother-in-arms Sir James Douglas, William showed his family trait for violence when he took control of the Douglas family name and estates by murdering his godfather.The curtain-wall castle is built of local red sandstone, and is considered by many to be the last of Scotland’s great castles.In 2009 pictures circulated on the internet and around the world showing what appeared to be a be-ruffed 17th-century gentleman peering out from the ruin’s windows. The photographer claimed that no one had been there when the photo was taken, and experts have been unable to pinpoint exactly what the image shows. Since then, ghost hunters continue to flock to the ruins, seeking further appearances by the mysterious visitor.',\n",

The area was slowly settled starting in 1902, and by 1925, a power company had come to the area to establish a dam on the Broad River. Once the river was dammed, the lake only took a couple of years to fill up, and a brand new rustic lake town was formed.While it is beautiful in its own right, the lake and its attendant town are likely more recognizable from films than from family vacations. Most notably, the lake is seen in Dirty Dancing.Scenic areas in and around the lake, as well as the Fairfield Inn, were also used for some of the filming locations. Thestaff cabins weredemolished not long after production, but the steps to the bridge are still there. The town even started an annual Dirty Dancing Festival in 2010, and in 2013, began donating part of the proceeds to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in memory of Patrick Swayze. (Note that part of the movie was filmed at Lake Lure and part at Mountain Lake in Virginia.

Few other hotels in North America can rival its grandeur.Tucked in Alberta’s Banff National Park, the hotel was built between 1887 and 1888 and opened to the public that year. At the time, though, the hotel looked almost nothing like it does today. The original 1888 structure was clad in shingles with stone accents, and featured a dormers, turrets, and roof lines. The building, in a sense, was a $250,000 mistake; the builder goofed and changed the intended orientation of the building, turning its back on the mountain vista.A major overhaul in 1906 began with the construction of the Painter Tower, named after chief architect Walter Painter, which was the tallest building in Canada upon completion. The eleven story tower, made of concrete and stone, was filled with 300 guest rooms and flanked by two large wings that were added later. The renovations weren’t completed until 1928.A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Banff Springs Hotel is currently operated and owned by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. As it is within walking distance of Banff and, though it offers championship golf courses, the primary recreational attractions are winter-based, the hotel was weatherized in 1968 and has been open year-round ever since.The world renowned skiing continues to draw visitors, but the hotel’s grand spa is also a major attraction. Solace Spa offers separate dressing and shower areas, private massage rooms, whirlpools, and aromatherapy saunas.

Another mural depicts a more medieval scene, a scantily clad warrior-woman rides a dragon into battle, and among the devil and nymph statues, a centaur rears up, bow and arrow in hand. This jumble of myths and fantasy artwork is not a haunted house or a film prop retailer, but simply the not-so-humble apartment building of two free spirits who rent to artists, musicians, and other like-minded folk that don’t mind their home being gawked at.El Bordello Alexandra used to be just that – a rumored bordello and heroin den with a slumlord that had little interest in caring for the historical 2-story building. When Tony and Brittany purchased the apartments over a decade ago, they gutted the promising structure and started from scratch. After the initial repair work was done, the two started hiring local artists to make it a place worthy of the label “bizarre” in a city that flies its freak flag so high it’s barely visible.

He never finished his project, which he had started 1989 using rocks and stones from around his property, and concrete to hold them together.Inspired by buildings he had seen over the years, Stokes started with a simple rectangular structure, put up with dry-stone techniques. Then he just kept going. He added turrets and dovecotes, stained glass windows featuring the seasons and the elements (which Stokes made himself), a spiral staircase, and beautiful arches. All of it was done by hand, and with no plans drawn up in advance.Several birds, including an owl, lived in the turrets and dovecotes while Stokes was building, and those parts are now dominated by birds. On the second floor, Stokes added a room for himself so he could live in the structure during lambing season, though he mostly lived in a nearby cottage.Built to blend into its surroundings, the building has come to be known as the “Hobbit House,” though Stokes takes issue with the nickname. He thought of it simply as his barn. To be fair, unlike a hobbit’s home, the structure is not built into the side of a hill. But it does look a bit like a hill itself.The barn is a little difficult to find, and is on private land. A sign discourages visitors, but it doesn’t seem to work.

Following its time as a hunting ground, the property was passed between a series of wealthy landowners. The elegant mock-Tudor style manor house that still stands today was constructed in 1862 for the second Lord Bagot.In 1937, the house was sold to the North Wales Counties Mental Hospital, which was in need of a second location to house overflow patients from the nearby Denbigh Insane Asylum(the super haunted one with all the cages and lobotomies). Pool Park held 87 patients at capacity, but in times of need had as many as 120. For a brief stint of time during World War II, the grounds also held a prisoner of war camp.Today, the solid wooden floors and intricate wood paneling have rotted due to water damage.

       "  'Situated on the banks of the Water of Leith on the edge ofEdinburgh stands an 18th-century structure so beautiful it’s almost hard to believe it was built for a well. Legend states it was discovered by a group of schoolboys who were out fishing sometime around 1760. But this became no ordinary well. In the latter part of the 18th century, locals believed the waters of this natural spring had medicinal healing properties.In 1789 the well was purchased by Lord Gardenstone. Mr. Gardenstone was a staunch anti-slavery campaigner. He spearheaded the city’s Committee for Abolition of the Slave Trade. In 1778, he was a central figure in a landmark case that oversaw the overturning of the subjugation of a slave named Joseph Knight, thus providing for his freedom and paving the way for the county’s eradication of human bondage.The ornate structure, designed by Scottish painter Alexander Nasmyth in 1789, displays how the city had embraced the Scottish Enlightenment. The building takes the style of a Greco-Roman temple, complete with Doric columns, a dome topped with a golden pineapple, and a statue of Hygieia, the Greek and Roman goddess of health. Over the doorway is the inscription “Bibendo Valeris”, meaning ; drink and you will be well.For nearly two centuries, people came to St. Bernard’s Well for what they called “taking the waters.” They believed the mineral-rich spring water could cure a variety of ailments, including muscle pain, arthritis, and even blindness. The well gets its name from a saintly monk from the 12th century, named St. Bernard ofClairvaux, who is said to have lived in a cave nearby. It was eventually closed in the 1940s because the water contained arsenic and other impurities.The interior of this impressive structure can still be explored today, though it’s only open to the public on certain days of the year. Inside, you’ll find a room with a decorative mosaic ceiling suggestive of a Roman temple. The room contains a pump adorned with a Grecian vase and a fireplace equipped with plumbing to dispense hot water.The well is said to have connections with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and her novel “Frankenstein”. In chapter 19 of the narrative, the character of Dr. Victor Frankenstein is describing the various attributes of Edinburgh: “The beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills… filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.”',\n",

The cottage was dismantled and rebuilt in 1869 to make room for Linderhof.Though much smaller, the architecture of the magnificent palace is extravagant with ivory candelabras and a carpet made of ostrich down. Inspired by Versailles, Ludwig created a mirror image of “Sun King” Louis XIV’s bedchamber and styled himself the “Night King.” Like his Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof was also deeply inspired by composer Richard Wagner. Many rooms sport the themes of some of Wagner’s greatest works.Amidst the forested mountainous terrain, Ludwig built huge ornamental gardens that borrowed styles from a number of other countries and eras. Perhaps the most extravagant is the “Venus Grotto” a man-made cave lake with a waterfall. Ludwig enjoyed rowing across it in a golden shell-shaped boat.

       "  'In medieval Europe, sharing a juicy piece of gossip could earn the speaker a punishment of wearing a humiliation mask, created just for this crime. A similar fate awaited men who told lascivious jokes, and those who interfered in other people’s business. A physical equivalent of social media shaming several centuries before Facebook and Twitter, the masks were fashioned out of iron and had exaggerated features representing each specific social misconduct. The “gossip” mask has long ears and glasses, to hear and see and everything, and an even longer tongue to show that the wearer was likely to spread the information quickly and indiscreetly. A number of these shame masks or schandmaske, intended to publicly humiliate the people perpetrating these acts, are on display at the Medieval Crime Museum in Rothenburg, Germany. From social shaming tools to more physically torturous devices, the museum chronicles the brutal history of over 1,000 years of crime and punishment in Germany and other parts of Europe. The painful private collection curated by a German publisher in the late-19th century was first housed, quite appropriately, in the tower of a castle hotel, and it took on the shape of a more expansive museum under the guidance of an artist couple. It moved into its current location, a former administrative building, in 1977 and displays over 50,000 objects relating to law and order as it was enforced and structured in the medieval era and thereafter.During those grim times, professional misdemeanors, too, were not excused. For baking bread loaves that were too small or light, bakers were locked into a cage and dunked repeatedly into water and off-key musicians were spotlighted with a shame flute fastened around their necks. An entire section is dedicated to the treatment of women, and to the terrible witch-hunt which took place in the Bavarian region in the 17th century.The beauty of the delicate carvings on a choke pear, a device with petal-like divisions, is swiftly overshadowed by its terrifying purpose—it was inserted into orifices of the human body, particularly for women, and slowly turned so that each leaf expanded, causing immense pressure, and the victim quickly admitted to his or her crime. More torture devices cruelly designed to extract confessions, true or false, from suspected criminals line the walls of this museum. The more procedural aspects of the legal system in the form of documents and trade exhibits are also on display and but the overwhelming tone is gruesome and chilling.',\n",

However, one of the most unusual of such places is situated in the heart of Copenhagen. The Rundetårn, literally the round tower, is noted for its lack of stairs. Instead this 34.8 m high tower has a smooth slanted spiral corridor. This 209m (964 foot) long spiral ramp winds itself 7.5 times round the hollow core of the tower. The tower was originally built as an astronomical observatory. The ingenious builders avoided the use of stairs in order to make the lugging and towing of heavy and fragile astronomical equipment to the top of the tower, possible.The tower was commissioned by King Christian IV and designed by architect Hans Steenwinckel the Younger. It remained in use as an observatory until mid 19th century when light pollution from the city and vibrations from the street traffic made accurate observations impossible. Today there is still an old telescope on the roof that is used by amateurs during the winter. However, the unusual internal structure of the tower gave rise to a quite peculiar activity, racing up and down the tower with various sorts of vehicles.In 1726, Emperor of Russia Peter the Great ascended the corridor on horseback. The first bicycle race in the tower was organized in 1888. In 1902, a Beaufort car was the first motorized vehicle to ascend this tower. The current bicycle record is 55.3 seconds and was set in 1993 by Ole Ritter in a race against Leif Mortensen. In 1989, Thomas Olsen went up and down the Rundetårn on a unicycle in 1 minute and 48.7 seconds.The upper part of the main facade is decorated by a gilded rebus, designed by King Christian IV himself. The rebus can be read as “Lead God, the right teaching and justice into the heart of the crowned King Christian IV, 1642.”The tower also contains a toilet used by the researchers and astronomers working in the tower and consisting of a seat almost at the top and a shaft leading down to the bottom floor built into the hollow core. This shaft has no way of emptying it nor any ventilation to the outside, making it arguably one of the world’s largest and earliest septic tanks.',\n",

I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. - Jack LondonJack London, well know as the author of Call of the Wild and lesser known as a booze hound and ladies man, died in the small town of Glen Ellen, 60 miles north of his hometown San Francisco, three years after his dream house, known as the Wolf House, caught fire and burnt down.While the ruins are known as the Wolf House, Jack and wife Charmian London lovingly called their dream house “The Big House” or “The Castle.” A big house it was; 15,000 sq ft, four stories with twenty-six rooms and nine fireplaces, and designed in a mixture of Spanish, exemplified by the terracotta tile roof, and Craftsman Styles, seen in the log cabin exterior and detailed wooden interior. The Wolf House was to become the London’s home, Jack’s workshop, Charmian’s tower, and an oversized cabinet of curiosities filled with the London’s unique collection from their world travels.Albert Farr of San Francisco designed the house and construction began in 1910. The dream home was nearly completed in August 1913 when it burnt to the ground. In 1995, a team of forensic experts concluded that the cause of the fire was likely due to a pile of oil-soaked rags, left by workers, spontaneously combusting.Jack vowed to rebuild the Wolf House, but with an insurance policy only paying out 1/8 the amount of money already poured into the project, he died three years later of kidney disease, having rebuilt very little.What’s left today are the haunting remains of the London’s dream home. The two lower stories of rock remain mostly intact, covered in moss and sprouting ferns, while the five towering chimneys built to support nine fireplaces are held up by massive steel support beams. A wooden walkway guides visitors around the ruins, keeping them safely away from the chimneys while affording beautiful views of the stone remains.Jack London State Historic Park houses the London’s collection in the Happy Halls House, which wife Charmian built after Jack’s death. Most of the furniture was custom built for use in the ill-fated Wolf House, and a corner of the house is set up to preserve Jack’s writing studio as it would have looked when he died. In this house the music of the time is played on the London’s piano by a talented volunteer and the walls are decorated with curiosities from around the world. As short walk from this house is the “Country Cottage” where they lived until Jack’s death and, if you are lucky, a docent will show you around the amazing gourmet kitchen.A short walk in the opposite direction are the graves of Jack and Charmian London.',\n",

When it was completed in 1932, it was the second-largest home in North Carolina, only rivaled by George Vanderbilt’s Biltmore Estate.Visitors to Graylyn may feel as though they’re being transported to medieval Europe as they step through the doorway of the manor house, and in a way, they are. The doorway was carved from stone in 15th-century France and imported to the United States to create Graylyn’s grand entrance.Nathalie Lyons Gray deep love for the medieval houses of Normandy is reflected in the exterior of the manor house, with its small windows set in stone walls and castle-like turret. The medieval theme makes its way into the interior as well. The cool stone entryway emits the smell of a wine cellar as you step through the doorway.While Nathalie Gray took inspiration from the Normans (as well as bits of Italian Renaissance and classical French styles), Graylyn’s style as a whole can best be described as English. England’s conservative taste, serious disposition, harsh climate, and available resources gave way to styles such as Georgian Revival, characterized by dark wood-paneled rooms and furniture, heavy fabrics and wallpapers, geometric designs, neutral, earthy colors, and subtly ornate carvings and patterns. Graylyn exemplifies this shift from old to new by blending stone walls, arches, and medieval tapestries seamlessly with the dark woods and masculine grandeur of the more contemporary Georgian Revival style.The Grays certainly had entertainment in mind when building their 60-room house. Private bathrooms in every room on the second floor featured gold fixtures, tubs made of solid marble, and showers with 17 heads. Guests could stay connected to the outside world through one of the 50 telephones and numerous radios throughout the house.Sadly, the Grays weren’t able to enjoy their lavish retreat for long. After her husband died, Nathalie Gray handed over the manor house to her sons and moved into the guest cottage with her new husband. In 1946, she donated the estate to Wake Forest University. Today, anyone can visit this enchanting property, as Graylyn became an 86-room hotel in 1984 and in 2016, joined the national registry of Historic Hotels of America.',\n",

Northeven mounted cannons up there, from which he fired salutes on the king’s birthday and after Britain’s naval victories. The strange-looking house, which came to be called Admiral’s House, located on Admiral’s Walk,was immortalized in literature by P.L Travers’s Mary Poppins series. In the booksa retired naval officer called Admiral Boom lives next door to the Banks family, in a house shaped like a ship, andfires his cannon every once in a while. Travers, a Hampstead local, got the idea fromher own eccentric neighbor.The Admiral’s House inspired many artists over the years. It was also the subject of John Constable’s painting “A Romantic House at Hampstead,” which is on display at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Some later residents of the house include Sir John Fortescue, a librarian and archivist at Windsor Castle, and his wife, Winifred Fortescue, an actress and novelist.

The Santa Justa Lift is a gorgeous fin de siècle solution to this problem that is still in use to this day.In the heart of Lisbon, the lower Baixa Pombalina district is separated from the higher Bairro Alto by a sudden elevation change of 45 meters (147 feet). As early as the 1870s, a lift system was proposed to facilitate the climb. First consisting of an animal-powered inclined rail lift, work began in 1900 to replace that with a vertical elevator. Inaugurated by King Carlos in 1901 and fully operational in 1902, the Santa Justa Lift has been shuttling people up and down ever since.The elegant Neo-Gothic iron tower was designed by Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard, an engineer from Porto who was a student of Gustave Eiffel. Originally powered by a steam engine, the elevator motor was converted to cleaner electric operation in 1907. Lisbon still has some older funiculars (i.e., inclined tramways) still in operation, but Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical urban lift.Today, the Santa Justa Lift operates almost 16 hours a day, seven days a week, with one of its two steampunky wood-and-brass cars departing every few minutes. A platform above the upper terminus can be reached by a spiral staircase, where one can find a cafe offering commanding views of Rossio Square, the Baixa, and some of the cool stuff (like a castle!) on Lisbon’s other six hills.',\n",

Instead of lions and tigers and bears, Swetsville offers massive metal spiders built from Buicks towering high in the air, castles built from concrete, and nostalgic characters greeting visitors of all ages. Alongside the classic dragons and choo-choos are aliens and dinosaurs, and things that, if they have names at all, you’d have to ask Bill Swets just what exactly they are.Bill Swets is the artist behind this motley metal menagerie. What started in 1985 as something to keep him busy during the throes of insomnia quickly developed into a calling, and now his creatures and creations delight visitors and locals alike. Part junkyard and part sculpture garden, it’s a strange and wonderful place that newcomers aren’t always entirely sure how to react to, but it’s a treasure in Fort Collins, considered both a display of public art and a popular park.While the Swetsville Zoo has been a beloved staple for decades, the signs of surrounding development do not bode well. Combined with some legal troubles involving a family member (unrelated to the zoo) and the regular wear and tear of weather, age and vandalism, it’s likely this fantastic sculpture zoo may not be long for this world. An odd footnote on the history of this family farm is that it was bombed by the Japanese during the end of World War II.Update August 2019: The zoo is closing.Update October 1, 2020: The Zoo is still open.Update September 6, 2022: The location is closing soon.',\n",

       "  'In 2002, while sorting through the basement at the Basilica of Saints Paul and Peter in Prague, members of the church stumbled upon several relics, one of which was labeled as the shoulder blade of St. Valentine. It is believed to have been brought to Prague in the 1300s by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, who lived in Vyšehrad, the castle that houses the church. St. Valentine’s bone is now on permanent display and celebrated with a mass every February 14th.Determining legitimacy is especially hard when it comes to relics of St. Valentine. There were a number of Catholic saints known as Valentine, and many years passed between their deaths and the distribution of their bones to churches around the world. At least two of the saints Valentine lived in Italy in the late 3rd century, and another in North Africa around the same time.Over time, the stories of these different men seem to have merged, and today most of the mythology about Valentine centers around him being a patron of lovers. In 496, Pope Gelasius I made February 14—originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia—a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine.Today, there are no fewer than 10 places claiming to house relics of St. Valentine around the world, including the Basilica of Santa Maria in Rome, Roquemaure Church in France, and Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin.',\n",

       "  'New Castle, Pennsylvania, was a booming town at the turn of the 19th century, when the local amusement park, Cascade Park, attracted people from around Pennsylvania and Ohio. Officially opened on May 29, 1897, the park had a dancing pavilion (once the largest in the state), an outdoor theater, a rollerskating rink, Caterpillar and Dodg’em rides, a grandstand, and an indoor a rollercoaster called “the Figure Eight.” Folks would ice skate in the winter and swim in the pool in the summer.Unfortunately, in the summer of 1927, a tragic accident occurred that would mark the beginning of the end for the park. Two guests died that were riding in the first car of the rollercoaster, which dipped through a gorge in the park. Some accounts said the victims were thrown from the car, while others said they were standing up in the car.After the deaths, the park put buckle straps onto the ride to prevent further issues, and the rollercoaster was eventually demolished due to termites.In 1954 a new rollercoaster was built, taking roughly the same journey as the previous ride. Still, in the decades that followed the park experienced many periods of poor maintenance, resulting in many rides being closed for safety or lack of insurance. Vandalism was rampant during the 1980s, even while the park was still open, including someone stealing 15 carousel horses.The second rollercoaster met its demise when a falling tree caused damage deemed too expensive to repair in 1982. The ’90s saw the park begin to look more like it does today: a nature park with picnic shelters, a playground, a restored carousel house, and fitness trail. While efforts have been made to repair the swimming pool as recently as 2014, you can still find the pool, closed, and in disrepair.Today, many different relics of what used to exist at Cascade Park can be found, including supports for the rollercoaster along the creek in the gorge (leading to a very pretty waterfall), the remnants of the dam that created the lake, several buildings, seemingly not in use, and random concrete slabs. Still, the park remains in use today for concerts, events, weddings, or a simpleleisurely stroll among the remnants of the abandoned rides.',\n",

For hundreds of years, the native people in the region chiseled away at the rock, creating crude shelters that needed much less upkeep than other primitive dwellings. By the middle ages, the caves were inhabited and being built by Catholic monks who constructed chapels, living quarters and other rooms to create a sort of monastery right into the side of the mountain. Eventually, the caves were taken over by knights from a nearby castle who used the now elaborate system of caves as military fortifications, adding wooden defensive structures and generally converting the in-ground monastery into a fortress of sorts. However once the feudal wars in the region were over, the caves were abandoned, leaving behind ages worth of relics, construction, cave art.In the end, the caves consist of around 70 rooms across five floors. Many of the rooms feature windows cut through the rock giving the complex the feel of a large termite mound when viewed from the outside. Many of the pillars and arches cut by the monks still remain along with a number of preserved medieval religious frescoes painted in still vibrant red ochres and black coals.Visitors are still allowed to enter the Jonas Caves, however despite the history of passed down construction, further expansion is discouraged.

Like many buildings from the nation’s founding, the ruins of the manor house are being restored for historic preservation. But this project is a bit different, as it will be encased in glass.When the project is finished, the bones and tendons of the house will be left exposed, and the glass facade will offer an unmasked look at the 18th-century craftsmanship and building techniques. The house will retain its original shape, and about 80 percent of the building’s original materials have survived, most in good condition.The sandstone used for the exterior and white oak and pine used for the interior all came from nearby areas and give Menokin a unique appearance when compared to the brick homes made during the same period in Virginia. More than 1,000 pieces of the intricately carved interior woodwork were removed in 1968 after a tree fell on the house. They were stored at Bacon’s Castle in Surry, Virginia, and later displayed at the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond until they were brought back to Menokin in 2004.The Menokin project is not meant to be a recreation of one moment in time or one period in history, but rather a continuum weaving together the threads of stories of centuries of inhabitation by many different races and cultures in order to help us find our place in the fabric of history, just like the marriage of architectural glass and 18th-century fabric.',\n",

He didn’t want it to become yet another boring pile of exhibits. Instead, he “put it together as if it were a film,” creating a series of rooms with motifs from every single piece of animation he had produced or found interesting, visitable in any order. The result is like stepping into the wizard’s cottage whilst he is away, with artist’s materials, animation cells, and sketchbooks preserved alongside overflowing ashtrays and cardboard boxes filled with reusable pencil stubs.The motifs begin when you step off the bright yellow bus - the bus stop is in the shape of the studio’s mascot, Totoro.One particular delight is the room that showcases different methods of animation, which draws your gaze from the zoetrope near the entrance, on past the moving wooden figures, pausing to see the stop-motion carousel spin up, then stopping dead at the Heath Robinson-like film projector in a glass case to view the “evolution of man” movie at different points in the projector.Another, sadly for under-12s only, is the playroom that holds a plush Catbus complete with chuckable Soot Sprites.The main attraction is the short film that can only be seen in the Museum in its tiny theatre. Rotated out every day, they are in Japanese (without subtitles), though it is often easy enough to follow regardless. You receive your ticket when you arrive, and may have to wait for 5-15 minutes to get seats.Photography is prohibited inside the building except in the rooftop garden, which is dominated by a huge bronze figure from Laputa: Castle in the Sky.There is also a cafe, gift shop, and bookshop inside, and a picnic park outside where families can sit under the cherry blossoms in March/April.',\n",

After hours, it belongs to the few dozen families that live within the castle, and the iconically outfitted Yeoman guards head to the private pub that’s tucked in the fortress wall.The super-exclusive Yeoman Warders Club is only open to the 37 members (and their guests) of the Yeomen Warder of Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Member of the Sovereign’s Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard Extraordinary. Or as they are (mercifully) more commonly known, Beefeaters.The Beefeaters have guarded the Tower of London since 1485, ever since King Henry VII, the first Tudor king. Their ridiculously elaborate red and gold Tudor state dress outfits have changed little since then, but their duties have changed substantially. Originally they were charged with guarding the Tower prisoners and protecting the Crown Jewels; today, they serve more as tourist guides and the subject of countless photos.There used to be many bars within the Tower walls, but only this one remains. It’s now called The Keys, though the original name is still displayed on the wooden door. The pub is 150 years old and about the size of a tennis court. Inside, it’s decorated with red leather benches and grim paraphernalia from the Tower’s past. The Yeoman Gaoler’s axe hangs on the wall above a plaque that used to mark the execution site, and the signature of a Nazi officer that was briefly imprisoned at the Tower is encased and on display.Beefeaters take turns working the bar, which serves locally brewed “Yeoman 1485” and “Beefeater Bitter” on tap, plus, of course, plenty of Beefeater gin. There’s a row of silver tankards lining one wall that are used in the swearing-in ritual for new recruits. The new members drink port from the tankards and the guards utter a long-held superstitious toast: “May you never die a Yeoman warder.”',\n",

It is a ghost city which gained popularity because of its beauty and its closeness to Rome and Cinecittà.Monterano has been a human settlement since the Bronze Age and grew into a flourishing town during the Etruscan Age. It got its name, “Manturanum,” in the Roman Age and regained much of its power and beauty in the Middle Age. A portion of the Roman aqueduct still stands as alonely witness to those days.The largest structure in the centre of Monterano is the castle. The stronghold was redesigned and reshaped during its life, up until the Baroque age. In 1679, one Prince Altieri commissioned the famous artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini to completely remake the fortress, transformingit into a modern palace with a beautiful fountain featuring a lion statue on top.In the same period, Mattia de Rossi, following Bernini’s project, built the San Bonaventura’s monastery which stands out on a plain a little farther out from the town and is also still visible today.In the following years, thanks to a movement of commercialpower and importance, the town began todecline. In 1799, after a fight between local families, the French army sacked the town and an outbreak of malaria soon followed. These combined disasters led to Monterano being all but abandoned in fairly short amount of time.It is said that the cause of the exoduswas extreme brutality perpetrated by the French soldiers who destroyed most of the buildings and the possessions of the villagers. It was basically cheaper and convenient for the population to simply leave everything and start from scratch elsewhere.The remains of the former settlement have since aged into beautiful ruins and Monterano has been the backdrop to a number films such as,Ben-Hur (1959), Mario Monicelli’s Brancaleone alle Crociate (1970) and Il Marchese del Grillo (1981), Marco Bellocchio’s La visione del Sabba (1988), among others.',\n",

This little Skye terrier known as Greyfriars Bobby was said to have stood vigil at his owner’s grave, for 14 years after his death. His dedication and loyalty became legendary, and when he finally died in January 1872, he was laid to rest in Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from his owner’s grave. The statue was erected the following year and is the city’s smallest monument.It’s a heartwarming story that has inspired numerous books, films, and even an episode of Futurama—but there’s a problem. It seems that the whole thing may have been a publicity stunt.In a 2011 book, author Jan Bondeson posits that the original Bobby was just a stray who found that by lingering around the churchyard he could get snacks from sympathetic visitors who assumed he was mourning the loss of his owner. Bondenson further suggests that the long life ascribed to Bobby (usually 16 years) can be explained by a mid-game substitution of a second dog, trained to stand vigil at the grave.The author believes that the caretaker of the cemetery, James Brown, actively cultivated this myth because it brought in tourist dollars, even in Bobby’s lifetime, and earned him a bit in the way of tips and lunch-time consideration.If this is the case, then Brown’s little stunt is still paying off. To this day, thousands of tourists pay their respects at the fountain and the nearby tombstone, leaving dog toys, throwing sticks, and bringing treats for the most loyal of dogs.Just a few doors up from the statue is the supposed location where Bobby was said to have dined upon hearing the One O’Clock gun go off at Edinburgh Castle.

Waters from ancient hot springs spilling down the hillside for a millenniahave formed terraces of oyster-shell shaped pools, the white travertine constantly refreshed by the flow of the calcium rich waters.Named the “Cotton Castle” in Turkish, the site has been celebrated as a natural wonder since the second century BC when the city of Hierapolis was formed around the healing waters. A thriving metropolis during the Roman era, the city survived and rebuilt several times following earthquakes, and it was not completely abandoned until 1300 AD. The ruins are extensive, including a Nymphaeum fountain which distributed water throughout the city, a large amphitheater, as well as the remains of the largest ancient necropolis in Turkey.Together with the ruins of Hierapolis, Pamukkale is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Before the designation, the terraces were in danger of being destroyed through a combination of neglect and commercial development. Hotels were built at the top of the site, partly obscuring ruins of Hierapolis , and wear and tear from the feet and shoes of visitors had scarred and turned many of the pools brown. Efforts to protect the delicate natural phenomenon have dramatically changed the area. Hotels have been demolished, and in an effort to allow the pools natural white appearance to be maintained, access to the pools is tightly restricted, and water released from the spring is controlled and only distributed to a few pools at a time. Artificial pools for bathing tourists have been added.Although natural phenomenon like this is exceedingly rare, a similar but smaller set of travertine pools exist in Huanglong, China. Sadly, another site beloved by Victorian settlers in New Zealand was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1886.Visitors should bring a backpack to comfortably carry their shoes, as you can explore the main drift of the mountain, but only barefoot.',\n",

Under the care of one of its latter day caretakers, Sir Richard Hill, the grounds were expanded to include a number of follies, small, decorative fortresses, natural features, and even a hermitage complete with a wisdom-spewing hermit. The medieval ruins were incorporated into the landscape as well as new attractions such as a menagerie and a greenhouse. The grounds became so popular that an inn was built on site to cater to increasing number of guests.Unfortunately, the good times could not last. By the 20th century, interest in the site had dwindled to a slow trickle of visitors and the expansive grounds fell into disrepair. By the 1980s things had gotten so bad that the entire complex was in danger of falling apart. Many of the features had been lost in the overgrowth or crumbled with time, and something had to be done lest Hawkstone Park be forgotten to time entirely.Luckily a group of concerned appreciators of the park banded together and were able to perform a major restoration of the grounds, which were once again opened in the mid-1990s.

A later discovery of rusty chainmail seemed to confirm the stories.Coronado is believed to have visited what is now the Kansas wilderness in the 1540s during his hunt for the fabled “Seven Cities of Gold,” also known as the “Seven Cities of Cibola.” Possibly rooted in Portuguese myth, the stories of these ancient sites of native wealth drove adventurers throughout the new world on fruitless quests for a generation.Inspired by the supposed firsthand account of a Franciscan priest in 1539, Coronado set off with hundreds of Spanish soldiers and native American guides in 1541, covering some 4,000 miles in search of the cities. Not keen to admit defeat, Coronado returned in debt but with claims that he had found one of the legendary cities, but far from the wild tales that had come before, he reported that all he found there were common native huts. Scholars have long debated just what either the friar or Coronado saw – were there ever truly “Cities of Gold” or just wild tales on the frontier? Several suggest that the friar only said what he knew people wanted to hear, and was essentially fabricating his sighting. Others believe that the stories may have a foundation in truth, long since lost.Today the site in Kansas is where Coronado may have ended his ill-fated expedition and returned to Mexico, disappointed.Looking like the remains of an old fortification, the little stone castle atop the hill at Coronado Heights Park was built under a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project in the 1930s, marking the spot where Coronado is said to have gazed over the flatlands.',\n",

Other European nations were interested in prisons as well and there was extensive international discussion on the correct way to rehabilitate a ‘criminal person.’ This collection was on display during the International Penitentiary Congress held in Rome in 1885.The museum today features many of the artifacts from the original collection, but it is organized along very different principles.

Solitary and hostile to men, they frequented the darkest depths of castles and caves, stealing human maidens and feasting on stray children. But then, in the 1960s, something went terribly wrong. The gnarled troll-folk of Norse and Scandinavian folklore were shrunk and plasticized into colorful little creatures with big hair and loveable smiles. Not exactly what Henrik Ibsen had in mind when he wrote “To live is to war with trolls in heart and soul.”And it’s these colorful little trolls that you’ll find under an old trestle railway bridge on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon.

For one thing, most Portuguese houses are not sandwiched between gigantic boulders.Defined by its landscape, Monsanto hangs off a mountaintop overlooking the Portuguese countryside, with views for miles.The mountaintop has actually been extremely important strategic position since prehistoric times. It’s crowned by the remains of a Templar castle, which was partially destroyed by an explosion, in the 19th century.The village has hardly changed in hundreds of years, and enjoys distinction in Portugal as a living museum. Due to this standing, Monsanto cannot be changed and has retained its classic village charm.Its tiny streets wind at a steep grade past red-roofed cottages tucked against mossy boulders. Some of the boulders are actually fitted with doors, leading to structures carved right into the rocky landscape.While the mountainous town seems a bit unorthodox, it is actually a unique twist on classic Portuguese architecture.Walking along the cobbled streets it soon becomes evident that Monsanto is a microcosm of Portugal. The architecture even incorporates the Portuguese Manueline style on a number of buildings and a church. While it certainly represents the classic Portuguese village style, visitors will no doubt be more impressed with the cottages built in boulder chic than medieval Romanesque or Manueline.',\n",

       "  'On a sleepy, off-the-beaten-track peninsula jutting into Ireland’s River Shannon, you can wander through Rindoon, one of Ireland’s most enigmatic deserted medieval towns. Though it was once one of the area’s most important towns, it has slept undisturbed for centuries.Rinn Dúin, the old Gaelic name, means “fortified headland.” Lured by its rich pastures and long vistas over the River Shannon, humans have lived on this beautiful peninsula long before invading Anglo-Normans first landed in its safe harbor in the late 12th century.A key military and trading frontier town between the warring provinces of Connacht and Leinster, Rindoon was a pawn in the wars waged between native Irish chieftains and Norman barons. Over the centuries, it has witnessed bloody battles, sieges, executions, and wholesale pillage as it changed hands repeatedly between the armies.Rindoon was one of a string of fortifications the Normans built to dominate the Shannon, strategically situated between the Norman strongholds of Athlone and Roscommon. The town itself lies behind a fortified wall, 20 feet high and 1,640 feet long, with towers and gates running across the St. John’s peninsula, protecting it from the mainland.The brutal Geoffrey de Marisco built the castle around 1227. Legends of Marisco’s corruption and treachery still linger in local folklore. Finally, even the Normans grew fed up with him, and he and his son William were outlawed and their lands—including Rindoon—were confiscated by the Crown. Undaunted, father and son took to the sea and became pirates, regularly raiding ships between Drogheda and Dublin.At its height, experts say the population of Rindoon was about 1,000 people, an impressive number for a time when the population of London was approximately 20,000. Safe Harbour was the main landing point for the town’s trade which, in its heyday, was highly profitable. Records show that in 1259, the town paid £8-5-8 in annual taxes, and by 1285 when taxes had risen to £320, the town was importing corn, cloth, and wine from Bordeaux.But the once-thriving town was not destined to survive. Historians say its isolated location made it too vulnerable to attacks from local Gaelic chieftains and too expensive to protect. The settlement’s isolation from other major trading centers didn’t help. And, as with other settlements, the Black Death may have visited Rindoon in the 14th century, hastening its decline.Now, the deserted town consists of a harbor, a castle, a church, and a substantial windmill. Just beyond the walls lie the ruins of an even older building, a 12th-century hospital that predates the walled town. You can still make out some plots around the castle where houses and gardens once stood, giving tantalizing glimpses of everyday life of Rindoon’s medieval citizens.Farther along are the massive cylindrical ruins of a windmill, first appearing in the records in 1273 when one Richard Le Charpentier got 45 shillings for steel to construct the mill. The surviving three-story-high mill dates back to the 17th century, although the mound on which it stands may have been part of the medieval mill used to grind local crops.',\n",

Growing up, he went on to become an electrical engineer and eventually Chairman of the Board of the electric company where he worked. Throughout his life, he maintained an interest in lapidary, the art of cutting and polishing stones, with a special fondness for jade and would often create pieces for his friends and family. As his collection grew over the years, Joseph felt the desire to display them so that the public could both enjoy them and learn more about the beauty of rocks and gemstones. To this end, he petitioned the City of Elmhurst and was granted permission to build a museum within the city’s Wilder Park. Construction was completed on a building that resembles a jewelry box and the museum’s doors opened in November 1962.Today the museum welcomes visitors from its new location in Oakbrook to both view some distinguished examples of the art of lapidary and learn more the array of minerals that make up our world. Housed within the museum are rare pieces such as a jade imperial altar set completed during the Ming Dynasty, (1368-1644), and a cinnabar screen encrusted with gemstones that was a gift to the Chinese emperor, Qianlong, in 1791. Both pieces were originally housed in the imperial palace of China.There is an interactive earth science center containing unusual rocks, fossils, and hands-on exhibits.

Craco was founded in the 8th century, and was a brilliant survivor considering the volatile nature of the medieval period. The village sits on a cliff 400 meters off of the ground. With panoramic views, the city center can easily be defended from the average barbarian horde.Despite its advantages, Craco is at a serious natural disadvantage. Exposed to the elements along with earthquakes and landslides, Craco finally caved in near the millennium.Even without residents, the storied history of the town has left quite a monument to medieval architecture through the ages. The striking castle was built in 1300 and dominates the view on the cliff. Along with the castle, a church in Craco houses a statue of the Virgin Mary that was remarkably discovered in a nearby body of water.Even though emigration has left Craco eerilyuninhabited, life returns to the town during one of the many religious festivals held there paying homage to the Virgin Mary and the statue. Six festivals happen in Craco from May to October. Visitors coming during other seasons can still enjoy the dilapidated town and views of the surrounding area, which include “calanchi,” arid and barren mounds below the cliffs of Craco.',\n",

He even had a name in mind: Shawfieldmont. But Bancroft’s dream project only got as far as the bungalow and tower, when he ran out of money. He kept the property for 12 years, but then sold it to to Harold Ayers, a physician who converted the structure into a sanatorium. Through the 1920s, patients in the area suffering from ailments like tuberculosis who could afford to pay $20 a week reaped the benefits of the fresh air and treatments offered by the Groton Private Hospital, as Ayers named his facility. When the hospital closed down toward the end of the decade, the space segued from sanatorium to social center, where dances and other events were held by the Groton Hunt Club. The fox hunting-related festivities came to end when parts of the structure were burnt down after a firecracker accident on the Fourth of July, 1932.Now part of a hiking trail, the castle ruins offer great views and a perfect dramatic backdrop for local photographers and cosplayers. As with any ruins in New England, combined with the local legend that the hill was used for hangings in the 1600s, there are plenty of ghost stories surrounding the hill, such as sightings of figures wearing colonial garb and sporting disembodied limbs.',\n",

It was the real-life home to Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassin, who briefly escaped in 1977. That escape inspired The Barkley Marathons (the race that eats its young), which usually features the tunnel under the prison as part of the 20-plus mile loop on the 100 mile race.The main building resembles amedieval castle; the stone for the walls was mined by incarcerated workers from a quarry on the property. The accommodations are sparse and cold—miserable to say the least. Murals and graffiti created by incarcerated people line the cell walls and the mess hall.A short historical documentary is shown in the museum, narrated by former corrections officers who also share stories of their time at the prison.

At first glance, it looks like any other typical monument, but a close inspection reveals that it’s crowned by a grisly carving of a hand holding a dagger and seven severed heads. Erected in 1812 by Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell, the Chief of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, the monument marks the spot of an ancient well and gives a nod to a horrific series of events.In 1663, Alexander and Ranald MacDonald were murdered by their cousins during a family brawl after returning from their schooling in France. Alexander was the 13th Chief of the Keppoch family and an unpopular clan reformer.After two years, no justice was meted out mainly due to the murdering MacDonalds having many sympathizers in that area. A kinsman to the victims, Iain Lom, Gaelic Poet Laureate of Scotland, sought justice and revenge. After appealing to Sir James of Duntulm Castle on the Isle of Skye, he agreed to apply to the privy council in Edinburgh who issued letters of “fire and sword” against the killers.Sir James’ brother Archibald was put in charge of 50 men and guided by a very eager Lom, who lead them to the murdering MacDonalds of Inverlair. The killers were served justice in the Highland way and decapitated. Lom then wrapped the severed heads in his plaid and washed them at the well before presenting them to Lord MacDonell of Invergarry Castle as proof before sending them to Edinburgh.During an exhumation of a mound in Inverlair, seven headless corpses were discovered, thus confirming the story of the Well of the Seven Heads (Tobar nan ceann).',\n",

The legendarily tireless Julia Morgan was California’s first licensed female architect, educated at University of California at Berkeley and L’École des Beaux-Arts in Paris before settling in the Bay Area. She was already engaged in a variety of projects, including William Randolph Heart’s “Castle” in San Simeon, but she attacked the new project with enthusiasm. She sent her artist and assistant Doris Day to Europe in search of antiquities to embellish her vision, and brought in local experts in concrete construction, mosaic work, and stained glass to bring it to life.Thousands of tiny niches filled with urns, many shaped like books, surrounding gardens, and quiet patio-like rooms, give the impression of a vast, light-filled library.More modern expansions add to the overall eclectic impression—from an area that was transformed from one of Oakland’s early trolley stations to Aztec-inspired additions made by Frank Lloyd Wright protégéAaron Green.The Gregorian cloister holds pages of illuminated manuscripts from 1550, and the small bible collection contains a page from a 1453 Gutenberg Bible.The Chapel of the Chimes has a performing arts history and today the chapel is home to regular musical performances including Jazz music and winter and summer solstice performances.',\n",

The fairies, horrified at this threat to their gathering place, used their magic to ruin the nobleman’s construction plans. Whatever the workers would build during the day, the fairies would destroy overnight.Angered by this, the nobleman decided to erect a net around the construction site. The hair of the most beautiful fairy, Ružica, became entangled in the net, and she was caught. As a warning to all the fairies, the nobleman built Ružica into the foundations of his city. However, the fairy curse did not end there. Just as the trumpets announced the completion of the construction, a stone slid down and killed the nobleman, ending his lineage.

As the youngest son of a baron, he did not inherit his family’s estate and instead embarked on a “career” as a mercenary on the European continent. Warring in France and Italy for a bloodthirsty band of soldiers of fortune, he was able to accumulate a vast amount of wealth.Upon returning to England in 1377, Dalyngrigge used his ill-gotten fortune to build himself a manor housein East Sussex. Later, he was encouraged to fortify his home by the Plantagenet King Richard II, who required fortifications in southeast England as a deterrence against an expected French invasion. Instead, Sir Edward opted to build a full-blown defensive castle on the land. Bodiam Castle was laid out with a square central courtyard guarded by four circular towers at the corner, and it seems to float atop the picturesque moat that surrounds the structure.Although the French invasion never came, Bodiam Castle did see action against another, internal threat to the English aristocracy: from the working classes during the peasant rebellion of 1381.In the neighboring county of Kent, the rebellion had been sparked by a poll tax imposed by the king on a population who had in recent years been devastated by the Black Death and famines, and who were tired of fighting the Hundred Years’ War with France.More than 600 years and much political turmoil later, the well-preserved imposing castle is still standing.

A writer, gadfly, aesthete, and prodigious collector of curiosities, Walpole first laid his eyes on the small estate of Chopp’d Straw Hill in 1747. He bought the property, renamed it “Strawberry Hill,” and embarked on a decades long project to turn the villa into a medieval style castle full of “gloomth” and wonder. He called Strawberry Hill his “little plaything…the prettiest bauble you ever saw,” and sat about covering it in towers, battlements, stained glass windows, spires, gold accents, and mirrors. It soon resembled an elegant, delightful, childlike perversion of medieval buildings like Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral, which Walpole had studied.Strawberry Hill became a tourist attraction during Walpole’s lifetime, becoming one of the first of England’s many estate-museums. A favorite spot for lovers was a particular bench in the lovely garden, which was carved like a giant Rocco style sea shell. Sightseers would often travel by boat and sail along the River Thames, disembark at the banks of the property and walk across the lawn. Walpole complained, rather disingenuously, about this onslaught of visitors and guests:“I have but a minute’s time in answering your letter, my house is full of people, and has been so from the instant I breakfasted, and more are coming; in short, I keep an inn; the sign ‘The Gothic Castle’ …my whole time is passed in giving tickets for seeing it, and hiding myself when it is seen. Take my advice, never build a charming house for yourself between London and Hampton Court: everybody will live in it but you”.The house also inspired what most scholars believe was the first Gothic novel. One night, Walpole was frightened awake by a nightmare. He dreamed that he had seen a giant armored fist on the highest bannister of the grand staircase at Strawberry Hill. This vision prompted him to write The Castle of Otranto, a runaway hit said to have inspired Mary Shelley. From its opening lines, it set in motion a romantic gothic tradition that continues into the present day:The gentle maid, whose hapless tale These melancholy pages speak; Say, gracious lady, shall she fail To draw the tear adown thy cheek?Today, Strawberry Hill is open to the public attached to St. Mary’s University, and still delighting and confounding visitors from all over the world.

Since the flow here is spread out, by using a series of little mills instead of one big water wheel, the diffuse water power could be aggregated. Pretty ingenious. Most of the huts go back to the period of the Austro-Hungarian empire (about 1867 to 1918), and they give the impression of a little storybook village.No longer used for actual milling, the Pliva Lakes watermills draw tourists down the river from the giant waterfall in town. That one is certainly impressive with its showy 65-foot drop. But the little shingled watermills feel like they might be home to some local trolls, with their dragons hitched up out back.',\n",

It’s also the starting point of a unique attraction, the Shimanami Kaido bikeway, a spectacular 43-mile route that island-hops its way across the Seto Inland Sea.Shimanami Kaido, which translates to the “Island-Wave-Sea,” is wonderfully and aptly named. It connects Japan’s main island, Honshu, with the island of Shikoku, passing through six islands along the way connected by one of the world’s longest series of suspension bridges.While it’s actually an expressway (also called Nishiseto Expressway), it’s unique for being the only land route betweenHonshu andShikoku that can be traversed on foot or by bicycle. Parts of the route are spectacularly scenic, crossing long beautiful bridges over bright blue water and lush greenery. Other parts pass through small towns with industrial and commercial areas.The entire ride can be done in a day for experienced cyclists. Most people start in Onomichi and head south to the town of Imabari on Shikoku island, where you can take a bus or ferry back. The route also passes by plenty of attractions like museums, temples, castles, cherry blossoms, and campgrounds that are well worth visiting along the way.',\n",

In the end, about 1,500 were murdered as a result of witch hunt inquisitions.However, mysteriously, there is no record ofa woman named Maggie Wall being tried as a witch. What’s more,there’sno record of the monument itself until 1866,though aforest surrounding the monument called Maggie Walls Wood was documented as of 1829.Some claim that Maggie Walldid exist, her records simply didn’t. Somelocals theorize that a member of the Rollos, a powerful family that lived in Duncrub Castle, had an affair with Maggie Walland built the monument out of guilt.Another theory is that Maggie was a part of a backlash against a group of officials trying to elect a new local minister. The group was attackedby a horde of women, and some believe Maggie could have been singled out and punished. The accepted theory is that this monument stands as a testament to all the witches murdered in Scotland during the witch hunts as no other such monument exists. Perhaps the name was taken from the surrounding wood to represent the countless and forgotten women who were killed. Occasionally a wreath is laid at the foot of the monument, serving as a reminder of the injustices suffered by the mysterious symbolic witch, Maggie Wall.',\n",

With three levels of exhibits covering a multitude of positions on Japanese sexuality, this cliffside collection is a popular stop that gives visitors a sexy, silly, and sometimes just weird experience into Japanese sex culture.Arriving by cable car, guests can marvel at the amazing view from the cliffs before delving into the museum which contains an array of enticing displays, including traditional Japanese sex artwork, holograms, figurines depicting fetishes such as Hentai and bondage, and abstract nude mannequin art. On the sillier side, which will provide awkward conversation but also makes it less creepy to be in a sex museum with your friends or family, are the more interactive displays. A carnival-like shooting game that blows up a Can-Can dancers dress when the bullseye is hit, a wind machine that when cranked, blows a life-sized Marilyn Monroe’s dress up ala “The Seven Year Itch”, and a giant penis ride you can climb on for a mere 100Yen. Despite the naughty theme, this museum is enjoyed by young and old, as long as the young are over 18.

       "  'Thrust into the middle of urban Philadephia is what looks like a great castle, a massive and haunting building. However, these walls weren’t built to keep Crusaders and robbers out, but to keep them in. This castle is a prison.Until this edifice was constructed, prisons had generally been commercial ventures, filled with prostitutes, booze, corrupt officials, and little to no order. Starvation, cold, disease, and violence often put an end to prisoners before they were even sentenced. Opened in 1829, Eastern State was designed by the “Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons” as a new type of prison where order reigned and those housed within might have a chance to be penitent for their crimes. Eastern State was to be the world’s first “penitentiary.”Compared to other facilities, Eastern State was a technological marvel and, at a cost of $800,000, one of the most expensive building projects of its day. At a time when President Andrew Jackson was still using a chamber pot, prisoners in Eastern State had their own private toilets. Inmates were served three hearty meals a day (usually boneless beef, pork, or soup and unlimited potatoes) and had their own private exercise areas. The cells each had skylights so that the divine wisdom of God might shine down upon those inside. In essence, Eastern State was a paradise compared to other prisons of the time. But despite all its material comforts, this “paradise” drove men mad.Known as the “separate system,” part of what made Eastern State unique is that prisoners weren’t allowed to interact with other prisoners at all, in any way. They ate alone, they exercised alone, and they read the bible (the only book they were allowed) alone. They weren’t allowed to talk to each other or to the guards. On the rare occasions they were taken out of their cells, hoods were put over their heads. Guards even wore felt shoe covers so as to keep the prison as quiet as possible. Utter silence, utter solitude. It was meant to inspire penance; instead, it inspired insanity.When Charles Dickens visited the prison in 1842, he wrote, “The system here is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confinement. I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel and wrong. I hold this slow, and daily, tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body.”Eventually, due to overcrowding and disapproval of the “separate system,” Eastern State changed into a more standard prison, known then as the “New York System,” in which inmates shared cells and were permitted to communicate.The prison remained in use for 142 years, from 1829 until 1971, and housed such criminal luminaries as Willie Sutton and Al Capone (Capone was allowed a comparatively lavish cell with furniture, oil paintings, and a radio). Left abandoned for many years, it was narrowly saved from destruction, and in 1994 Eastern State re-opened its massive doors to the public. Left in a state of magnificent decay, anyone who finds themselves in Philadelphia would be well advised to pay a visit - and to be penitent.The self-guided audio tour features interviews with former inmates and guards, and is narrated by actor and director Steve Buscemi. The penitentiary offers a number of special tours, including “prison uprisings,” Winter Adventure Tours, a Bastille Day celebration, and a Haunted Halloween tour.Obscura Day location: April 9, 2011.',\n",

As they arrive at the gates, far too few stop to notice the statues positioned on either side of the main entryway.Sir William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, two of Scotland’s most celebrated historical figures, stand guard outside the castle. Tinted a greenish-gray with age, the bronze men stare down upon the millions of tourists who enter Edinburgh’s famous attraction each year.The statues were erected outside the castle in 1929, though the men had been celebrated for centuries before. Both were prominent leaders during the First War of Scottish Independence, which began in 1296 and lasted for roughly three decades.Sir William Wallace (the statue on the right), famously depicted in the movie Braveheart,was among the first Scottish leaders to revolt against King Edward I of England. After winning the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, he was knighted and named a Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland. He continued fighting against the English reign until his capture and brutal execution in 1305.Robert the Bruce declared himself King of Scots in 1306. He, like Wallace, fought valiantly during the war. However, unlike Wallace, Bruce had royal ambitions fueling his desire to free the Scots from English rule. After years of successful guerilla warfare, his battles and raids eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton in 1328, which recognized Scottish independence under his rule—at least, until his death a few years later.',\n",

A secret surgical hospital was built under the hill which ministered to victims of the war both during and after formal hostilities were underway. In 1958, with the fear of Cold War WMD’s gripping countries across the globe, the hospital was expanded to include shelters from both nuclear and chemical attack. Luckily the shelters never had to be used, and eventually the facility was opened to the public as a museum in 2008.Today the Hospital in the Rock Museum lets guests wander through the cramped operating theaters and machinery filled nuclear bunkers, all of which have been restored to their wartime conditions. Gruesome (and not a little creepy) mannequins reenact medical scenes and visitors can even take part in a competitive nuclear readiness drill against other tourists.The Hospital in the Rock is just one section of the miles of tunnel beneath Buda Castle, with other sections being taken up by wonders such as the Labyrinth, but the hospital museum may be the most historically enlightening.

Directed by Neil Jordan and starring Annette Bening and Robert Downey, Jr., the story revolves around a woman whose psychic connection to a child killer tragically entangles her family and buffets her sanity.The film takes place in Massachusetts and was filmed in the towns of Northampton, Easthampton, and Northfield, MA. However, one of the more visceral scenes takes place in New Hampshire, in a giant, decaying ocean-liner-shaped hotel on the coast.In the movie it was called the Carlton Hotel, and Annette Bening’s character has a premonition of wandering around its decrepit grounds and interior to eventually find her dog eating the body of her husband in one of the rooms. In reality, the hotel is the Wentworth by the Sea, which was built in 1874 on the bridge-accessible island of New Castle, NH. When In Dreams was filmed, the hotel was exactly as it was portrayed in the movie, abandoned and dilapidated. However, since that time, it has been refurbished and reopened as the impressive resort hotel it once was.Perhaps even more impressive about the grand hotel is that it provided the setting for an important historical event. Within the walls of the extravagant accommodations, Russian and Japanese delegates met to discuss the end of the Russo-Japanese war.Terms were agreed upon and theTreaty of Portsmouth was signed at the nearby Portsmouth Navel Shipyard. Along with ending the fighting, thearrangement earned US President Theodore Roosevelt the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in mediating the event.Adapted with Permission from: The New England Grimpendium by J.W.

The Ladew gardens and estate were established in the 1930s by wealthy eccentric Harvey S. Ladew. The rich huntsman was enamored with English culture and design, especially the tradition of fox-hunting. So great was his love of the pastime that when he went to create his grand estate, he made sure that it shared a border with a hunting club.Ladew bought over 200 acres of land in 1929 and set out to turning them into the lush, elaborate topiary gardens that stand today. Again inspired by an English landscaping trend at the time, the garden was designed with 15 “rooms,” which are small areas devoted to a single color or theme such as roses, or simply, yellow. The grounds contain multiple fountains and pools, and are surrounded by shaped and trimmed hedge formations that look like something straight out of a lush castle yard.Possibly the most telling and singular piece among the opulent garden is the shaped hunt, where bushy dogs chase a topiary fox across the grounds.

The fort was one of several that ringed the District to guard against Confederate attacks, but these forts went severely undermanned when Union General Ulysses S. Grant moved many of their troops to Petersburg, Virginia to support his Overland Campaign. Hearing about the state of the forts, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered General Jubal A. Early to attack the capital from the north. From July 10th through the 12th, 1864, troops and artillery from Fort Reno and nearby Fort Stevens engaged the Confederates, until Early finally retreated. He told his officers, “We didn’t take Washington, but we scared Abe Lincoln like Hell.”During the war, a community of formerly enslaved people lived around the fort, many assisting in its construction. After the war ended, the fort was dismantled and the site was made into a reservoir with an accompanying sandstone castle. The original owners of the land around the reservoir returned and eventually had the land subdivided into lots they called Reno City. Eventually, the neighborhood became a community of primarily Black families.As the District of Columbia street grid advanced north in the early 20th century, plans were formulated to replace Reno City with a park and high school. The changes were part of a general plan for segregation of residents in the northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia. Despite efforts by the residents and prominent African-Americans, by the 1940s nearly all of the original houses were gone. Today little evidence remains of their history other than a lonely fire hydrant, a few foundation stones, and the Jesse Reno School east of the reservoir.A separate plan to construct a vast circular park at the Fort Reno, circling the reservoir and taking advantage of the views, was put forward by the McMillan Commission, especiallyFrederick Law Olmsted Jr. This plan never came to fruition.The reservoir and castle are fenced and off-limits to the public; however, the surviving highest natural point, just off of Nebraska Avenue on top of a small hill,was marked with a plaquein 2007.During the Cold War, Fort Reno became hostto “Cartwheel,” one of seven government sites to be used in the event of a nuclear attack.

While the ruins are a popular attraction, the new castle is not open to public visits.The remaining walls and turrets of Old Wardour are now kept in bucolic splendor by the English Heritage Commission and the grounds are a favorite spot for picnics, weddings, and even films looking for an authentic European ruin. There is a complimentary audio tour available and the attendant gift shop even sells foam axes and swords so kids can play out their medieval fantasies. Although these foam battles are generally less harmful than the medieval reality was. ',\n",

Ernest built them a little home that looked a bit like a gingerbread house, and installed a gravity water system using the waterfall across the highway, which is still in use today.When Rogers Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams’ unusual haven, and in 1960 they decided to officially open up their Enchanted Forest to the public. What was once just a project they enjoyed together to invent their own happy place for their retirement was now a highly popular tourist spot for sightseers. One could not drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house belonging to the couple that created it all.By 1970, a million people had stopped to visit the castle and marvel at the statues and tree houses and all the other surprises nestled in the Needhams’ forest. The couple realized that it had become unmanageable, and their retirement idea had turned into a challenging full time job. Wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor before it was too late, Doris and Ernest sold their forest to Rocky and Juliet Ehlers and their children, Aza, Silas and Naomi.Fortunately, the Ehlers loved the Enchanted Forest for what it was, and have continued to care for it and keep it available to visitors. The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage with ferns growing on the roof, or a favorite nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest treehouse in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.',\n",

The Cork Butter Museum tells its story, going back as far as their prized possession — a wooden barrel of thousand year old bog butter.The Museum is in the Shandon section of Cork, the historic market center of the city. Known at the time as a “shambles,” open markets and butcheries like this one go back centuries. Cattle and dairy farming had traditionally been the most important domestic industries in Ireland, and beginning in the 1700s the export market for Irish butter began to flourish. By the mid-1800s the market in Cork had the largest butter exchange in the world, and Irish butter could be found on tables across the globe, from North America to the Caribbean to India.Housed in the former market, the Cork Butter Museum is next to the Firkin Crane Building, an unusual rotunda that was originally part of the exchange. Built in 1855, it sits on the site of the medieval Shandon Castle, and today is a public performance space.The museum also tells the story of how Kerrygold came to prominence in the international butter market in the second half of the 20th century. Tracing its roots all the way back to that thousand year old bog butter, Kerrygold (a product of the Irish Dairy Board, Ireland’s dairy cooperative) has continued the tradition of exported Irish butter. It still makes its way around the globe, sitting in just about every dairy case next to the Land-o-Lakes and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter.',\n",

Architecture buffs would marvel at the 13th century mortar work, lovers of fantastic scenery would find the cliffside view mind-blowing. Poenari Castle doesn’t need a sordid story to be spectacular, but it happens to have that as well.The story is a legendary one and to many, a confusing mixture of truth, history, legend, and fiction due to the convolution between the novel “Dracula” and the factual history of Vlad III Dracula “The Impaler”, whose name inspired the book. Bram Stoker modeled some of his main character on the more basic facts about Dracula’s actual life, but his knowledge of Romanian history and the true story of Vlad the Impaler remains suspect.The true Dracula, (Turk-impaling Prince of Wallachia as opposed to the sultry blood sucker) fell in love with Poenari Castle in the 15th century, and realizing its potential as a major stronghold with an amazing vantage point, consolidated and fixed up the crumbling fortress, making it one of his main places of residence. It’s said that his first wife, whose name is debated among historians, flung herself from the towers of Poenari during a siege by Vlad’s muslim brother, Radu Bey. Before flinging herself into the Arges River below, she exclaimed she would rather rot and be eaten by the fish than to be a captive of the Turks.In the end the walls of Poenari would not keep Dracul the Dragon safe, but it was not the fortress that failed him. Vlad’s brother Radu cel Frumos was given the daunting task of leading the Ottoman Empire to victory, which positioned him directly at odds with his infamously brutal older brother. While Vlad could not be defeated in battle, his habit of alienating allies and undermining their authority became his downfall. After running out of money for his mercenaries, he went to his supposed friends for help, and they quickly betrayed him, and had him arrested for high treason. While he managed to untangle himself and went on to declare a third reign, it was an uphill battle that eventually killed him, and he never returned to his castle on the hill.Poenari Castle is located on the right side of the Transfăgărăşan road in Argeş County, on a cliff near the Făgăraş Mountains. In 1888, a landslide brought a portion of the fortress crashing down the cliff, but otherwise the structure has been mildly maintained and can still be visited today, but there is quite a climb to reach the ruins – over 1,000 steps.Update as of June 2022: Currently closed for renovations.',\n",

The artwork offers an amazing glimpse of the unique culture that once flourished throughout eastern and northern Scotland.Centuries after the Picts used the caves, they were visited by Christian pilgrims and hermits, who also left their marks on the walls.

The restored Gothic structure that took its place ultimately met its end in 1540 during the anti-Catholic rampages (known officially as the Dissolution of the Monasteries) which followed Henry VIII’s separation from the Catholic Church. Additional damage was done by German battleships in WWI, aiming for a nearby signal station.The resulting ruins are atmospheric, beautiful and have inspired many writers and artists, including Bram Stoker, who used Whitby as the location for the first landing of Dracula in England. It is fitting, as it’s said that it was here where the author himself first discovered the real Vlad Dracul in 1890, in the pages of a book he checked out from the local library.Whitby Abbey has become something of a Goth pilgrimage site, and touristy Dracula-related locations of dubious literary or historical significance have followed in their wake.Whitby is also home to the Whitby Museum, Library, and Archive containing many varied and strange items from Tempest Prognosticators to an alleged Glory Hand.Elsewhere, Stoker found additional inspiration at Eastern European and Scottish castles, and closer to home at St. Michan’s Church crypts in Dublin, where you can still visit the mummies today.

In order to be constructed at this specific place, the Ecopod has to be built in a way that it would leave no long-term trace on the land and have the smallest carbon footprint possible. The design of Ecopod was so successful, actually, that its carbon footprint is less than two percent that of a typical building of similar size.Arguing that tourism needs nature, the Ecopod’s design team built an outer membrane that allows the dome to blend into its surroundings. The dome also brings nature inside, with all of the fuel for the wood pellet stove coming from the Highlands and a water supply for the boiler streaming down a hill through the forest. All waste water is then cleaned and returned to the stream some 15 meters from where it was taken.',\n",

The origins of Edinburgh’s Jacob Ladder are first recorded in an article written in 1784, though it is thought to be much older than that.This pathway, which cuts through volcanic rock, is thought to have had many different uses and configurations over time. Prior to the construction of the North Bridge in the mid-1700s, which connects the High Street with Princes Street, there weren’t many ways for someone to get from the Old Town to the New Town. Jacob’s Ladder allowed people and goods the ability to get in and out of the city more efficiently, without having to travel greater distances. This was especially handy because at the time, the Nor Loch, a body of water stretching along the full distance of Princes Street, prevented access to the docks in nearby Leith.This trail also allowed mourners to get to the Old Calton Burial Ground, and was most likely the route prisoners were taken to reach the former Bridewell Jail. Tourists have been clambering up these steps for centuries to get unparalleled views of the castle, the city, and access to the monuments atop of Calton Hill.

Even the newer ones are from the Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance periods, and together, along with the formal gardens, they make up one of the largest castle complexes in the world.Along the north side there is a wild glen called Jelení příkop (the Deer Moat), originally part of the Castle’s fortification and later a private hunting ground for the king. The royal stock of stags (and even a few bears) is gone, and today the Deer Moat is a public park of inviting lawns and shaded woods, with a stream channeled down the middle.It’s all easily traversed via stone steps, paved paths, swinging timber walkways, and a 275-foot (84 m) pedestrian tunnel that runs underneath the famous Powder Bridge.The opening up of the Deer Moat and building of the tunnel were pet projects of former President Václav Havel, who wanted to give visitors an easier way to take advantage of the extended Castle grounds. He brought in Czech architect Josef Pleskot to design the tunnel, which incorporates the moat’s stream, much of which had been relegated to underground pipes in the late 19th century.Pleskot kept the stream, called the Brusnice, as part of the overall underground experience of the tunnel, an oval tube of elegant brick work that feels at once enveloping and expansive. The sloping curve of the walls was designed to create this sense of comforting roominess, to belie the tightness of the quarters–no doubt making some grateful claustrophobics in the process.Update as of October 2019: The Deer Moat is closed for the rest of the 2019 viewing season due to reconstruction.

Ferdinand’s opulent tastes were imposed on the builders and designers, creating a schizophrenic manse that, at least from the outside, seemed to indulge any and all of the king’s passing tastes. One portion would resemble a medieval European castle complete with ornate parapets, then the portion directly next to it would be modeled after an Islamic tower dome. Each section of the facade was also presented in a different color; a long purple wing is flanked by a red clock tower, and a yellow minaret and so on. It is said that Ferdinand wanted the palace to look like an opera. It is now seen as one of the grandest examples of Romantic architecture. The interior of the palace was no less opulent or eclectic. Many of the rooms were designed to reflect a certain cultural influence ranging from Middle Eastern styles to the European Baroque.When the royal family fled Portugal during the Revolution of 1910, the palace and its grounds were abandoned and fell into disrepair. However the site was restored later in the 20th century, and is now classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The palace can now be visited by any peasant willing to make the trek, and it is well worth it since visitors essentially get to experience a whole world of architecture in one stop.   ',\n",

It was a big enough area that he had to hire help to clear the area, so he hired a man named Mortimer Stump, who lived in the cabin on the property with Balch’s family of 10. Over time, Stump and Balch’s daughter Anna fell in love, and eventually Stump asked Balch for his Anna’s hand in marriage. Balch refused, resulting in Stump and Anna threatening to elope. Balch became infuriated and told Stump that he would murder him if they did. The young couple didn’t heed the warning, and decided to elope in November of 1858.When Balch learned of the elopement, he became deeply depressed, which led to days of no sleep and of heavy drinking. When the young couple returned to Portland, Balch quickly remedied the situation as he saw fit: He shot Stump in the face with a double-barreled shotgun while all were aboard the Stark Street Ferry. Balch was quickly arrested, but was able to escape from the wooden jail he was held in.This led to his execution in mid-October of 1859, which became the first legal execution in Oregon.After Balch’s death, the property was passed around through different hands down the next century, eventually bequeathed to the city of Portland. In the 1930s, the stone structure that is seen today was built near the site of the Balch homestead.It was maintained by Portland Parks and Recreation, and was used as a park ranger station and restrooms for hikers. In 1962, the structure was heavily damaged in a storm and was abandoned. Moss soon covered the stone walls, the roof caved in, and some people graffitiedits walls. It was mostly forgotten until the 1980s, when local high school students found it was a fun place to hold parties. The students named it “the Witch’s Castle” (despite no connection to witches) and made a tradition of holding gatherings on Friday nights, something that still happens today.',\n",

Why, New Orleans of course.The first official cocktail, a little libation that went by the name “The Sazerac,” was a concoction of French brandy, water, sugar and bitters, and was allegedly dreamt up by a man named Antoine Peychaud in an apothecary shop in New Orleans’ French Quarter. The legend of the early mixologist and his signature drink lives on to this day, the spread of the story encouraged by the tourist industry and state legislature (The Sazerac is New Orleans’ official cocktail) but like many things in this mysterious city, the tale has some smoke and mirrors, and facts have been… embellished.It’s a little strange for the curators of the Museum of the American cocktail to deny the fact, especially when they have a newspaper clipping from 1806 that contains the first use of the word ″cocktail″ in America, which is considered the a holy relic for mixologists and cocktail affecinados. However, one of the curators of the museum, Phil Greene, is a direct descendent of Antoine Peychaud. While he believes that his crafty relative Peychaud was quite the clever fellow, it would have been impossible for him to invent the cocktail in 1806 since he was only three at the time.However and wherever the cocktail originated, the Museum of the American Cocktail has been recording and celebrating the history and evolution of the cocktail through the years. The museum was originally a traveling exhibit going from New York to Las Vegas, but it finally found a permanent resting place inside of the Southern Food and Beverage Museum on Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. The museum contains a variety of cocktail and bar memorabilia from antique cocktail shakers, cups, and bottles, to pro- and anti-prohibition propoganda.While it might seem like a place where you could get a drink, the museum does not have a bar on the premises.

       "  'Tintagel Castle stands on windswept cliffs in North Cornwall overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. If it looks like something from an Arthurian legend, that’s because it is—the gorgeous castle is said to be the birthplace of King Arthur.Before proceeding, it should be noted that Arthur may or may not have existed. Likely, as a single historical figure, he did not. There is almost no solid historical evidence of his having existed, though there is also almost no historical record of that time in England at all. A Welsh figure of legend, Arthur was already the stuff of mystery and myth when theHistoria Regum Britanniae first introduced him to the non-Welsh world in the 1100s.Of course, this doesn’t stop anyone from visiting his supposed birthplace.Tintagel Castle is a medieval-era relic located on the small peninsula of Tintagel Island, next to the village of Tintagel. Historians believe the site was most likely used in the Romano-Celtic period. Hints abound that the site was a high-status settlement that acted as an important trading location between the British Isles and the Mediterranean region.The castle is thought to have been a residence of the King of Dumnonia. After Cornwall was absorbed by the kingdom of England, a new(er) castle was built upon the site by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1233. Both before and after that renovation, the site had long been associated with Arthurian legends.In the semi-mythical book, The History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth,Tintagel was singled out as the birthplace of the historically debatable King Arthur.An artificial hollow in the rock at the highest southern point of Tintagel Island is locally known as “King Arthur’s Footprint.” It may have been used for the inauguration of kings at some point in medieval history.The castle didn’t realize its destiny as a tourist destination until the Victorian era, when Arthurian legends were in vogue. This fascination has carried into the modern day, and visitors travel for miles to catch a glimpse of the supposed home of the legendary figure.Starting in 2015, English Heritage embarked on a project to “reimagine Tintagel’s history and legends across the island site.” This included Merlin’s Cave, where a bearded face was carved into stone to represent the legendary wizard, as well asGallos,an eight-foot-tall bronze sculpture of a ghostly man wearing a crown and holding a sword. In 2019, acantilevered steel footbridge connecting Tintagel Island and the mainland was completed and opened to the public.A series of archaeological excavations in 2016 and 2017 uncovered the remains of relatively structures dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries, as well as shards of pottery and glass.',\n",

Built in 1915, the late Gothic revival building looks more like a castle than a medical facility.

It was these sculptures that caught the eye of Alabama billionaire George Barber, who wanted some dinosaurs for himself. He had Cline install four—a brontosaurus, a T. rex, a stegosaurus and a triceratops—along the edge of the woods near Barber Marina in Elberta. Barber was so happy with the ginormous creatures that he commissioned Cline to create a replica Stonehenge for the marina property, reminiscent of the “Foamhenge” that Cline built in Virginia in 2004.Both Foamhenge (made entirely out of styrofoam) and Bamahenge are full-size, exact replicas of the real thing, right down to their orientation to the sun and the summer solstice. And since third time’s the charm, Barber added one more Cline piece to his collection: called “The Lady in the Lake,” it’s a 50-foot fiberglass woman floating in a manmade pond nearby. It’s recently been reported that the original Foamhenge will have to come down, the land underneath it to be absorbed into a Virginia state park.

       "  'In the coastal cliffs beneath Tintagel Castle lies an echoingly atmospheric cave. And if the stories of old are to be believed, the cave may once have been home to Merlin, the wizard of Arthurian legend.Most prosaically, Merlin’s Cave is a 330-foot-long sea cave formed by marine erosion. It stretches all the way beneath the craggy head of land on which Tintagel Castle stands, allowing you to enter from one side and exit out the other. It is, without doubt, an impressive cave in its own right.What makes the coastal cavern extra special, however, is its association with the legend of King Arthur and the wizard Merlin. Tintagel Castle has long been linked with King Arthur, as far back as Geoffrey of Monmouth and his book the Historia Regum Britanniae, written circa 1135.Ever since, Tintagel has been connected with Arthur, although many historians argue that the evidence connecting the two (and indeed the very existence of Arthur and co.) is sketchy at best. Either way, people love a good story. And Tintagel has become a physical embodiment of this tale, both the castle above ground and the cave below.The cave and castle gained greater fame following the publication of Tennyson’s Idylls of the King between 1859 and 1885. His cycle of narrative poems retold the legend of King Arthur, and included the tale of the infant Arthur being washed ashore at Merlin’s feet:“They found a naked child upon the sands / Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea; / And that was Arthur; and they fostered him / Till he by miracle was approven King”Today, the cave is inextricably linked to Merlin, so much so that local authorities hired the artist Peter Graham to carve Merlin’s bearded face into a rock near one of the cave entrances. It was immediately a controversial move, with some people calling it vandalism and the dumbing down of British history.Still, it’s there now and people continue to walk down the rocks to explore the sandy-floored cave at low tide, imagining Merlin walking there, carrying the future king in his arms.Update as of June 2022: The entrance to the cave is closed due to rockfall.',\n",

Everything seemed to be possible, even razing a small ancient village in the middle of nowhere.That was the idea the enigmatic entrepreneur Mario Bagno, had towards the quiet, rural town of Consonno. Bagno bought up every plot of land in the village and forced the small population to reloccate before razing the entire settlement save a few houses and the church.After the old Consonno was demolished, the new Consonno could be built on its ashes like some mentally-ill phoenix. Bagno began building a Las Vegas-like complex called the “city of toys,” hoping to draw tourists from Milan which was just an hour away. The pleasure paradise was to be outfitted with shopping malls, restaurants, ballrooms, and at least one luxury hotel, each facility themed after different type of architecture. The commercial gallery had the shape of a Muslim minaret, there were Chinese pagodas randomly standing in the gardens, and a fake medieval castle was placed at the entrance. Had the project been completed, there were also plans for a basketball court, a zoo, and a new autodrome.While many of the buildings were almost finished, the main road to Consonno was washed away a few years after the construction was started, eliminating the site’s main flow of customers and effectively killing the project. Now the odd, half-completed village of kitschy buildings is abandoned and crumbling under decades of neglect and graffiti.

       "  'There are differing legends about how the city of Krakow got its name. Fortunately, every version involves a dragon.According to the stories, a ferocious dragon once lived in the cave that is now part of the Wawel Castle complex. The lizard terrorized the city below for many months, requiring weekly offerings of cattle. Should the townspeople fail to provide the requisite number of animals, the dragon would scorch and devour an equal number of human beings. Here’s where the stories diverge. One says that a cobbler named Krak came up with the idea of stuffing a dead sheep full of sulphur and leaving it out for the dragon as a handy snack. Once eaten, the sulphur ignited in the creature’s belly, forcing it to gulp down gallons of water from the River Vistula until eventually, it exploded. Krak then married a princess, became king, built a castle atop the cave, and named the city in his honor.In another version, the dragon appeared during the reign of King Krakus (sometimes called Gracchus). The beleaguered king asked his two sons, Lech and Krakus II, to rid the city of the fiery scourge. Lech and Krakus came up with the same solution as cobbler Krak, but following the dragon’s explosion, began to quarrel about which of them deserved credit for the dragonslaying. Lech killed Krakus, and told the townspeople that his brother had been killed in battle. When the secret was eventually revealed, Lech was exiled from the country and the city was renamed for the innocent Krakus.The cave itself where the dragon is said to have lived is made up of a series of limestone rooms, that in medieval times served as a tavern and brothel. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction. A fearsome bronze sculpture by artist Bronislaw Chromy was installed at the entrance to the dragon’s den in 1972. Although the sculpture has seven heads, only one breathes fire (thanks to an ingeniously-placed natural gas nozzle).',\n",

Unfortunately some of Britain’s old conflicts came with them when Spanish forces came up from the south and attacked the fort in an engagement that came to be known as the Battle of Bloody Marsh.

It was the subject of William Wordsworth’s elegiac 1803 poem, Address to Kilchurn Castle, upon Loch Awe.Today, Kilchurn stands open to the elements. However, several wooden staircases and walkways built into its fabric allow visitors to climb the original five-story tower and other parapets. The tower offers staggering views of the hillsto the north, and of the distant abandoned viaduct. Looking back down the loch, a panoramic display offers views of the final resting place of the medieval Dukes of Argyll, and the small chapels built on the loch’s many islands.The castle can be accessed by the A85, but is probably best viewed from the loch itself. Small boats can be rented from nearby Dalmally and taken right up to the castle, where a jetty has been built on the eastern side.',\n",

There are Venetian wind-up automatons that pour wine and various other ornate cabinets and contraptions. The collection even includes such contested items as the solid gold drinking bowl of Ivan the Terrible. The literal crown jewel of the Green Vault is the impossibly rare Dresden Green; amassive, naturally irradiated, green diamond from India. The diamond is on par with the Hope Diamond and the Mountain of Light in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. It is an internally flawless hunk of beautiful green carbon mounted in a hat clasp and no picture will do it justice.The moniker “Grünes Gewölbe” did not derive from the Dresden Green diamond however. The green in the the vault’s name came from malachite columns that had been painted green at the base and crown as well as green velvet wall coverings in some parts of the treasure rooms.In 1945 over 90% of Dresden was destroyed in a vicious fire bombing by the British RAF. During this attack the Dresdener Residenzschloss (Dresden Castle), which held much of the collection, was obliterated. Sadly many great works of art and treasure were lost in the fire bombing of Dresden and original “greens” of the Green Vault were lost with them. However in the early years of World War II a majority of the treasure in the Green Vault was moved to the Königstein Fortress and survived the destruction of the Dresden Castle.In the 1960’s reconstruction was started on Dresden Castle and as of 2013 the renovations have finally been completed. The new interior of the Green Vault produced two separate museums, the New Green Vault and the Historiches Grünes Gewölbe (Historic Green Vault), containing a staggering 4,000 items between them. However, the original green color for which it was named is only present in the magnificent diamond that highlights the end of the tour.

       "  'As thrones go, it is hard to beat the Throne of Denmark for ambitious construction with its exposed “unicorn” horn and life-size silver lions as its constant companion.Constructed in the late 1600s (long after unicorns supposedly missed the ark) the physical seat of the monarchy of Denmark’s power is a grand throne straight out of a fantasy novel. The regal white throne was originally constructed as a large wooden chair with arches and an intricate canopy, with the extravagant flourish being the spiraling legs and spokes which were said to be made of actual unicorn horn.In reality, no mythical beasts were harmed in the making of the furniture piece, but instead the horns were narwhal tusks which were often passed off as the product of a magical horse in those days.Later kings would add gilded figures who perch on the arm and backrest of the throne adding an extra level of luxury to the seat, but much of its notoriety still stems from the seemingly magical building material. The throne was inspired by the biblical Throne of Solomon which was fabled to be guarded by 12 lions, and to reflect that aspect, the throne is always accompanied by three massive silver lions. The life-size sculptures are arrayed around the throne in resting positions and feature solid gold eyes, manes, and rumps.The Throne of Denmark was mainly used for coronation ceremonies before they were largely omitted from the country’s royal practices, and now the magical seat is simply a wondrous museum piece even though it still acts as the representative seat of the monarchy. Update as of August 2021: The white throne has temporarily moved to the sister castle Koldinghus in Kolding, 144 miles (232 kilometers) west of the Danish capital. There it will stay “for a year or so” before returning to its Copenhagen home at Rosenborg Castle, according to the museum staff.',\n",

But at the Seven Keys Lodge (formerly known as the Baldpate Inn) in Estes Park, Colorado, all three of these places are represented—in the form of keys.The small bed and breakfast is home to the world’s largest collection of keys. With a total of more than 20,000 keys, there are three keys for every resident of Estes Park. Organized categorically by state, the collection is hung on the hotel’s ceiling and walls and has been receiving donations since the end of World War II.Featured in the key room are keys to a variety of European hotspots, including Westminster Abbey, Mozart’s wine cellar, Frankenstein’s Castle, and Adolf Hitler’s bunker. There is an extensive U.S. collection as well, with keys from the Pentagon and the White House bathroom, and the international collection includes a key to a Peruvian monastery and a key made in Egypt.If you look closer, keys from even more precarious circumstances can be found. There are keys to robbed banks, the dressing rooms of Hollywood actors, and yes, a piano key. Most of the keys in the collection have been donated by guests who stayed at the inn, spanning a wide variety of states and countries. If you visit, you can make a donation too!The Baldpate Inn was established in 1917 by brothers Charles and Gordon Mace. The hotel’s name and the idea for a key collection came fromSeven Keys to Baldpate,amystery novel written in 1913 about a man who visits the then-fictional Baldpate Inn to find some peace and seclusion. Unbeknownst to this man, six other characters also have a key, and they promptly open to door to the inn and distract him.Due to the similarity of the Estes Park lodge to the inn described in the story, the owners decided to name the hotel after the fictional inn in the novel. Subsequently, the key room was created to honor the importance of keys in the book, a literary tribute that has been transformed into a world record.Earl Derr Biggers, the author ofSeven Keys to Baldpate,eventuallyaccepted the Colorado establishment as the “true” Baldpate Inn.In December 2020, the Baldpate Inn came under new ownership.Mark and Meredith Powell have taken over the Estes Park landmark, and are working to restore the 100-year-old inn.

       "  'Castle Otttis (yes, three ‘t’s) was built by Ottis Sadler and Rusty Ickes between 1984 and 1988. Based on Irish castles from 1,000 years ago, it was designed to be a landscape sculpture, open to the elements and rising up more than 50 feet.When Sadler and Ickes began work on the castle, it was never intended to be a residence or a business. Their ultimate aim was to create a work of art, one that would invoke the spirit of an old Irish abbey or Christian church.The two men took care of all the masonry themselves with no additional paid labor. And once they had built the walls high enough to be noticed with ease, they were told they needed a construction permit. Due to a clerical error, the building was accidentally officially designated as a garage, albeit a garage built of split-face concrete blocks, reinforced steel rods and poured concrete weighing an estimated 7 million pounds. With ramparts. And 88 window openings, left without glass to allow the elements into the castle. In other words, not your average garage.Once they had completed the main structure of the castle, work began on the interior. This was handled by one man, Lee Carpenter, who took three years to complete all the interior woodwork, mainly working with cypress wood and some old southern heart-pine. Between 1988 and 1991, Carpenter built eight elaborate staircases, an altar, a pulpit, a series of pews, a choir loft and a bishop’s chair.The final result: a majestic stone castle built as an expression of artistic and spiritual devotion. And, of, course, an impressive new landmark along the St. Augustine shoreline, one officially recognized by the American Institute of Architects in 1992.',\n",

Barony Castle, near the Scottish burgh of Eddleston, was requisitioned by the Polish army in World War II for training. Jan Tomasik, a Polish sergeant with the armored division, was stationed nearby helping to defend Scotland from the Germans. After WWII, Tomasik decided to remain in Scotland, reluctant to go home due to the new political regime in Poland. After the war, Barony Castle was turned into a hotel and in 1968, Tomasik actually purchased the castle and renovated it.Witha keen interest in topography, Tomasik wanted to build a scale map of Scotland on the grounds of the castle, as a thank you to the state that had become his new home. So he envisioned the Mapa Scotland, as The Great Polish Map of Scotland is also known. Construction began in 1974 and was completed in the summer of 1979. The map ended up being highly accurate despite its epic scale, measuring over 160 feet by over 130 feet, and ringed in by a squat wall. It also hadrunning water in its rivers and lochs that was supplied by a system of pipes.Tomasik hoped the map would bring new visitors to the castle, including royalty. Sadly this was not the case and after Tomasiks death, the castle was again sold and the huge concrete map fell into obscurity and neglect. The water features dried up and the continents began to be lost beneath weeds and moss.Finally, in 2010, a group was formed called “Mapa Scotland” tobring the colossal model back to life. They received a small heritage grant and work began. Today, volunteers have gotten the map to a viewable state. While it no longer features the original painted colors or flowing rivers, theGreat Polish Map of Scotland can still make visitors feel like a Celtic god.',\n",

       "  'About 50 miles north of New York City, and only a thousand feet from the Hudson River’s eastern shore, there is a small, rocky island named Pollepel. On it stands what appears to be a crumbling Scottish castle. It is indeed the remains of an empire.Francis Bannerman was born in Dundee, Scotland in 1851 and immigrated to the United States at the age of three. While living and attending school in Brooklyn, New York, Francis began collecting and selling scrap from the harbor. In 1865, at the age of 14, Francis founded his own company to sell military surplus goods.The business, called Bannerman’s, went from selling scrap metal and munitions, to full ships that Francis purchased at Navy auctions. Some notable merchandise sold by Bannerman included cannons from the Battle of Yorktown, unopened crates of Civil War uniforms, and relics from Admiral Perry’s expedition to the Arctic Circle. His customers ranged from the early American film industry to Buffalo Bill. Entire U.S. Army regiments bought from Bannerman during World War I. It is estimated that 50% of the commemorative cannons placed in public areas throughout the United States were purchased through Bannerman’s.With an appetite for growth, Bannerman bought 90% of the US army surplus after the Spanish-American War, some of which was salvaged from the sunken USS Maine. So much equipment and ammunition was acquired in this transaction that city laws forced the businessman to look for storage outside of city limits. Fortunately for Bannerman, his son David happened across Pollepel Island while canoeing on the Hudson. In 1900, the family purchased the island as a safe storage site and, a year later, construction began on a Scottish-style castle and residence.The designs for the elaborately decorated buildings were drafted by Bannerman himself, but the constructors were allowed to interpret these designs on their own. Nearly all of the construction was completed without professional help from architects, engineers, or contractors. Although most of the buildings served as storage for the business’ inventory, a smaller castle on the top of the island was built as the family’s summer home. While Mr. Bannerman took to decorating the home with items from his surplus collection, Mrs. Bannerman beautified the paths and terraces with flowers and other plants, some of which can still be seen today. With the words “Bannerman’s Island Arsenal” cast in large type on the castle’s side, the building was also a giant advertisement for the business, and is still visible to train passengers on the Metro-North Hudson line.Construction halted with Bannerman’s death in 1918, and the island has experienced a turbulent history since then. Just two years later, 200 pounds of shells and powder exploded, destroying a portion of the complex. Nevertheless, the family continued to use the residence through the 1930s. Disaster struck again in 1950 when a squall caused the sinking of the ferryboat Pollepel, which serviced the island.In 1957, the property’s last superintendent retired and the island was left vacant for the next three decades, despite being sold to the state in 1967. A devastating and suspicious fire burned for three days in the summer of 1969, leaving much of the structures in ruins. Vandals, trespassers, and negligence have all contributed to the island’s current state of decay.Since the early 1990s, however, the Bannerman Castle Trust has worked for the preservation of the island so that the public may appreciate it for its cultural and historical value. The organization aims to stabilize the remaining structures, all of which have lost their internal floors and non-structural walls. Today, hard hat walking tours are given by Castle Trust historians from May through October.',\n",

       "  'Following the “Great Earthquake” that rocked San Francisco in 1906 that saw hundreds dead and countless more homeless, the McCloskey Castle was built as a reactionary defense against any further natural disaster, but its idiosyncratic design is just one of the strange things buried in the castle’s past.San Francisco attorney Henry McCloskey commissioned construction of the eccentric building just a year after the devastating earthquake hit the city, eventually forcing his family to move in to the castle before it was even completed, assumedly due to his ever-present fear of disaster. The strange medieval European style of the castle was established in its very first incarnation.By 1916, the McCloskeys had vacated the castle and ownership was turned over to a doctor who neither lived nor worked in the building. As eventually came to light, the doctor had been using the castle as an underground abortion clinic, and he was sentenced to years in prison . The doctor’s son then took over the space, taking a page from his father’s notebook, and he too was soon arrested for once again operating an illegal abortion operation.After that scandal, the building was taken over by a restaurant calledChateau LaFayette, although this seemingly upstanding operation held secrets of its own in the form of a speak-easy operating under U.S. prohibition. Like the barbarians of old, federal agents frequently raided the castle.Once the speak-easy was forced out of the space it ended up in the strictly religious hands of Clarence and Annie Eakin. The couple used the space for war effort fund-raising and eventually leased the property to the Coast Guard who briefly turned it into a communications post.It was not until 1959 that the final owner, interior decorator Sam Mazza, purchased the castle, which had fallen into disrepair through its many lives. Mazza restored the residence to its original glory and filled the space with artwork and artifacts from all over the Bay Area. While Mazza never moved in, he used the space to hold lavish galas and fundraising events.While Mazza passed away in 2002, his foundation now maintains the space with the same devotion that he brought to it. Long since removed from its defensive origins, it is now the tenants who are setting out to protect the castle instead of vice versa.',\n",

Enormous, beautiful, and creepy, Wilson Castle is part of a 115-acre estate in various stages of disrepair. It’s hard to imagine a building more incongruouswith its surroundings.You approachthe estate (it’s a real castle, tour guides explain, because it has battlements and towers) by turning off the main highway by a truck parts shop and traveling for a mile or so on a sparsely populated rural road near Rutland, Vermont. Neighboring buildings include small ranch houses and trailers.It was always a slightly unusual building for the area, which was, perhaps, the point. A Vermont doctor, John Johnson, built it in 1867 to impress his wife, who was an English aristocrat of some sort. According to the story, Johnson met her when he attended medical school in the United Kingdom. It took eight years and $1.3 million to finish the castle. Mrs. Johnson returned to England after living only three years in the castle with her husband. After she died her husband had to sell the castle.The property was juggled from one owner to the next for the next 50 or so years until falling into the hands of Herbert Lee Wilson, an AM radio pioneer who created a radio station in the castle stable, which, though its headquarters have since moved, is still on the air today. Five generations of Wilsons lived at the house from 1939-2009. When Wilson’s daughter passed away, it opened for tours in 1962 and is still owned and operated by Wilson’s granddaughter, Denise Devine.The castle is a peculiar mixture of 19th-century architectural styles including Dutch Neo-Renaissance, Scottish baronial, Queen Anne, and Romanesque Revival. Consisting of32 rooms (though only a few of these are available for touring), 84 stained glass windows, and 13 fireplaces, the building is lavish in a way that’s unique for Rutland County, and even for the Gilded Age. Each room has different woodwork to match its furniture, some of which are priceless. Due to the travels of Wilson (who was also an army officer), the castle is decorated with impressive and valuable Far Eastern and European antiques, Chinese scrolls, and lavish rugs. The Wilson Castle tour is novel in that visitors can walk on the carpets, touch some of the furniture, and take flash photography.Depending on funds and maintenance, and concerns about visitor safety, various parts of the estate are added and subtracted from what’s available on tour. Most of the rooms originally had elaborate murals on the ceiling—an owl near the study, a rendition of the sky on the drawing-room ceiling—but many of those are gone now or covered over due to water damage and the expense and difficulty hiring workers to repair and maintain such decorations.',\n",

Not so much.With construction beginning in 1911, the castle was assembled under the watchful eye of Mr. Chester Thorne, starting with the remains of a dismantled 15th-century English house. The palatial manor was downright majestic, deserving of “castle” classification. At the end of construction, Thornewood was 27,000 square feet and had 54 rooms, including 22 bathrooms. The 35-acres that surrounded the castle were transformed into gorgeous English gardens strewn with elegant statues, and a secret “sunken” gardendesigned by the Olmsted Brothers, out by the pool. The home was enjoyed by Thorne and his family until it was inherited, upon his death, by his daughter Anna, with strict instructions to never part with the property. Anna promptly sold it to a developer, who wasted no time legally maneuvering through the restrictions of the will.Long story short, it’s now a bed and breakfast.Thornewood is a very popular subject in ghost hunter circles, and although now there is an alleged back trail of all kinds of sightings, the haunting rumors coincidentally started popping up after the estate was used in Stephen King’s horror film Rose Red, where it portrayed a diabolical soul-sucking house that kills anyone who enters. It was also the star of the sequel,The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. It was after the two films circulated that stories of apparitions and cold spots began to emerge. Weird.The couple who owned the castle-turned-bed & breakfast ran with it, as any enterprising business owners would. Then, Thornewood changed hands once more, and suddenly, its story underwent a rewrite. The new owners spun the story that Thorne built the house as a very expensive labor of love for his precious bride, Anna. They call it “The House That Love Built,” and have done their best to erase any trace of haunted history. Insulted paranormal bloggers called out the newowners for trying to erase the haunted mansion’s history, and sneered at the complete lack of ghostly acknowledgment except for a small mention in their FAQs that reads, “Is Thornewood Castle haunted?” Answer: “Only in the movies!” followed by a smiley face.An official historical site, the Thornewood Castle can be rented out for events and weddings, and still maintains a steady flow of bed & breakfast enjoyers.

It was 1932, and unemployed craftsmen were plentiful. Over time, though, theproject became increasinglyambitious. In 1936 she was asked to create a miniature version of the library at Windsor Castle to mark the (ill-fated) coronation of Edward VIII.Inspired tocreate more facsimiles of real rooms from some of Europe’s mostimpressive castles, museums, and homes, she hired architects andmembers of the Needlework Guild of Chicago to get the designs just right, down to the tiny textiles and carpets.The Thorne Miniature Rooms are beautiful examples of painstaking craftsmanship, and of architecture and interior decoration from specific places and periods. Visiting theThorneMiniature Rooms Exhibition allows museum-goersperiod-accurate glimpses into European and American interiors from the late 13th century all the way through the 1940s, in a way that logistics like time and spacewouldn’t otherwise allow.

       "  'The fantasy Moorish design of the Arab Room, reminiscent of pre-Raphaelite visions of harem rooms, was designed in the 1880s by architect and medieval revivalist William Burges for the castle’s Victorian-era owner, John Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute.The architect was inspired by his extensive travels as well as the works of French Orientalist Emile Prisse d’Avennes, who published a popular collection of Arab designs in 1877. Described as “arguably the apogee of Burges’s work as an interior designer,” the Arab Room is stunning even amongst the grand halls, gardens and wood-paneled library Burges created at Cardiff Castle.In order to accommodate the Arab Room’s elaborate high-vaulted ceiling, the upper two floors were removed. The ornate golden ceiling is not simply gold paint but is in fact pure gold-leaf painstakingly applied by hand. While the use of gold leaf is common-place throughout the opulent property, it is estimated that the gold in the Arab Room alone amounts to a whopping £8 million.Cardiff Castle itself dates back to at least the 11th century at the site of a much earlier Roman Fort. Traces of the Roman wall can be seen as well as the Norman Shell Keep in the center. The residence and garden grounds of the castle were extensively overhauled under that patronage of the 3rd Marquess of Bute, who allowed Burges a perfect playground to exercise his passion for Gothic and medieval design, mingled with a romantic Victorian sensibility. Throughout the building eclectic architectural and cultural influences commingle under elaborate fantasy ceilings.William Burges died in April 1881, before the Arab Room was completed. In memorial, Crichton-Stuart had the words, “John Marquess of Bute built this in 1881. William Burgess designed it” carved into the overmantel in Latin.',\n",

A grandson of the first Laird of Yester, he served as a guardian of the young Alexander III of Scotland, and was by repute a magician and necromancer, known by many as “The Wizard of Yester”.It was in the under-croft of the castle that The Wizard was thought to practice his sorcery. 14th century chronicler John of Fordun mentions the large cavern in Yester Castle, thought locally to have been formed by magical artifice. Legend also supposed that Hugo was able, via a pact with the Devil, to raise a magical army to his aid, and use them to carry out his will. It is this army of hobgoblins that was considered to be the builders of Yester Castle.Little remains of the castle today, but the subterranean Goblin Ha’ (Gobiln Hall) is still largely intact. The Hall is described on the Royal Commission of the Ancient Monuments of Scotland website as follows:“On the W of the enceinte are the remains of another range of buildings now only a few feet above ground, and from the most northerly of these, a stair leads down to the “Goblin Ha’”, an oblong chamber 37ft by 13ft 2ins, built of ashlar.The “Goblin Ha’” may date from the 13th century and the western range was probably built towards the end of the 14th century, while the masonry of the enceinte walls would appear to be of 15th century date.”',\n",

       "  'Looking out to the North Sea, this beautiful castle, set on a cliff south of the town of Stonehaven, evokes a distinct connection with the site. You can almost see the Viking ships chopping the surf and the servants bustling about to tend to the visiting royalty.While it is not known how long ago this site was originally inhabited, it is believed that its establishment came in Pictish times between 5000 BC to 700 AD. The Pictsreligious systemworshipped nature spirits, and the site was seen as the home of the “green lady,” who symbolizes the strong feminine nature of the surrounding area. After the Picts converted to Christianity inthe fifth century—when St Ninian chose the Dunnottar site for one of his churches—the “green lady” was said to have been seen looking for her “lost children,” having been seen in the brewery of the castle.In the ninth century, the Vikings invaded, seized, and destroyed the castle, having defeated King Donald II as he tried to protect it. While the current chapel was built in the 16th century, the previous chapel was consecrated in 1276 after the site became a Catholic settlement. A 15th century poet, “Blind Harry,” whose epic poem was the inspiration for the film Braveheart, declared that William Wallace set fire to the original chapel, which was full of English soldiers seeking refuge.The castle was home to the Earls Marischal, one of the three offices of State, along with the Constable and the Steward. The main responsibilities of the Earls Marischal were ceremonial events, the Honours of Scotland (the Crown Jewels),and the safety of the King in parliament. Several monarchies stayed at Dunnottar, including Mary Queen of Scots.Today the gorgeous ruins of the castle rest atop their rocky perch, looking like something out of a fantasy novel, and given the site’s mystic religious roots, that’s not far off.',\n",

       "  'Nuremberg and the castle it was centered around have a long and storied history. The town was part of the Holy Roman Empire (HRE), which lasted from the rule of Charlemagne in the 800s CE until the founding of the German Empire in 1871. For political history, a millennium is a really long time. The United States have been around for less than a quarter of that.The Holy Roman Empire morphed throughout its history to include different states, factions, and kooky leaders. Who inherited the title “Roman Emperor” had little to do with Romans and everything to do with the Roman Catholic Church and the lords of the various Germanic lands, who conquered what had been most of the Western Roman Empire after the year 405 CE.Voltaire once said that the HRE was neither Holy nor Roman nor an Empire. Whatever it was, it was not a highly centralized state, but one made up of hundreds of semi-allied fiefdoms, states, and cities—at times covering most of Europe except for England and western France. For much of its history, the HRE included Italy and Burgundy, in addition to what we now call Germany.As an important city during the life of the Holy Roman Empire, Nuremberg hosted legislators and court sessions. And like any respectable town in the High Middle Ages, it had a castle.In the 19th-century, the infamous and enigmatic Kaspar Hauser is said to have been housed in the Luginsland Tower of the castle where he was later to be imprisoned as a “vagabond”. In the 20th-century, this same tower was to become the site of a popular Hitler youth hostel that housed hundreds of the leaders of the movement.Though damaged during World War II, the castle has been restored to its original state. The Double Chapel in the center of the castle remained unscathed during the War. The castle offers tours of the Double Chapel and the Imperial Castle. The Imperial Castle Museum contains an array of artifacts of historical interest, including antique weaponry, official documents, and the Holy Roman crown jewels.Visitors can also climb the Sinwell Tower to get a great view of the city beneath the castle. The “Deep Well”—the site’s medieval water source, descending 50 meters down into the castle rock—is also worth a look in and a tour guide provides an immersive demonstration on the hour, every hour.What’s more, the old emperor’s mews now features a youth hostel where you can sleep like a king … or at the very least like a king’s horse.',\n",

       "  'The city of Wheeling, West Virginia is steeped in a mythology of excess in decline. Once home to more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the country, populated with gangsters and tycoons, skimming off shipping along the Ohio when industry was rich, recent decades have dealt the city a hand equal to that of its Rust Belt brethren. This means that teasing out fact from fiction can, at times, be a tricky proposition. Such is the case with the Mount Hood Overlook, often referred to by locals as “the Castle.”Popular legend says that an unknown soul abandoned the magnificent dream structure when his lady love unexpectedly perished. After some digging, however, local historians established that at least some of these aspects were true. In 1925, this property actuallybelonged to alocal doctor who set out to build this dream home as a gift to his wife. Naturally, it would have a rounded, turret-like architectural feature with windows looking out on the best view of the city; the remnants of this, including its spiral staircase, and a second story form the entirety of the Mount Wood Overlook we know today. Unfortunately, the enterprising man in question was hauled off on federal drug trafficking charges before the structure was completed, and the property was “donated” (read: returned) to the City of Wheeling, which has retained control ever since.With languishing funds in all its coffers, the space has declined over the years and is nearly unrecognizable from the top. Only those curious enough to walk down its staircase and look up from the brush will seethe potential ofwhat it could have been.Among those who recognize its potential are those on the Wheeling Arts Commission, which has established a mission to reclaim the Castle from vandals. Through a project of “Guerrilla Gardening,” started in the summer of 2015, volunteers applieda natural slurry to growmoss in artistic patterns on top of the existing spray paint, which they see as an eyesore encouraging further blight upon the city.Across the road from the Castle is the Mount Wood Cemetery, which holds many old graves and mausoleums from many of Wheeling’s first residents. With grave markers dating back to the 1700s, many are so old and weatherbeaten that the inscriptions of their names and dates are illegible. Making use of the steep hillsides are dozens of sepulchers built directly into the earth. As with many of the mausoleums which contain remains of the early city’s most important families, the doors and windows have long since gone missing, only to be cemented closed by modern masons or padlocked shut to prevent further damage. Despite this, these limestone, brick, and marble structures and their cast iron trimmings retain a sort of sad beauty.Despite its picturesque location, a potent mixture of time, neglect, and vandalism have resulted in many of toppled obelisks and tombstones snapped off at the ground. Some gravestones have been paved over with asphalt to create the walking path through the cemetery. Nonetheless, the grounds provide a haunting-yet-fascinating glimpse into the former grandeur of Wheeling’s citizens in the face of America’s blue-collar economic downturn, all while standing in the very same spot that inspired the city’s founders in 1769 to attempt to “tame” the landscape in the first place.',\n",

The castle was erected between 1873 and 1875 as a retreat home for summer time and it was named Winnekenni, an Algonquin word meaning “very beautiful.”Nichols treated the castle’s construction as an experiment. He was determined to prove that rocks and boulders could be a good source of construction material for farms and other buildings in the county. He published a book based off his experience in 1876 called, Boulder Rocks: Their Probable Origin and History and their use in the Construction of Dwellings.Winnekeni Castle stands about 250 feet above Kenoza Lake, and has a spectacular view of some adjacent towns and county. As is typical for a summer house, the interior of the castle has some unique architectural features including a gothic door, a Pompeian dining room, a library, nine bedrooms, a bathing room, and four towers with roof access. Outside, an extensive lawn surrounds the building.In 1885, the castle changed hands from Nichols to his cousin William Webb. Ten years later it was sold to the city of Haverhill, and became the first public park in the area. Its elaborate Victorian interior was destroyed by a fire in the late 1960s, but the exterior stood strong. Today, Winnekenni Castle is part ofover 700 acres of conservation land known as Winnekenni Park Conservation Area, which also includes some nine miles of hiking trails.',\n",

Madame Sherri, born Antoinette Bramare, marriedactor and dancer Andre Riela in 1911, and the couple moved to New York and changed their name to Sherri. Mystery surrounds the reason for this name change as well as other aspects of their life together. In New York, Madame Sherri made a name for herselfdesigning elaborate costumes for Broadway productions, most notably the Ziegfeld Follies.After her husband’s death, she decided to build a unique structure in the woods of Chesterfield, New Hampshire, tohold parties for her theater friends. Madame Sherri lived in a more modest house nearby and used the bigger property to entertain. The quirky “castle,” as it became known locally, had three storiesand a massive staircase outside the house. A lot of this was made possible by the generous gifts Madame Sherri received from her former assistant Charles LeMaire, who later went on to become an Academy Award-winning costume designer. When this money ran out, the parties too came to an end, and the castle fell into disuse. Madame Sherri fell on hard times and died in poverty in 1965, as a ward of the state.The dramatic staircase ending mid-air is all that remains of the castle today. After falling prey to vandals, the castle was destroyed by a fire in 1962, leaving behind only the foundations and a section of the staircase.Locals have reported hearing and seeing strange things in the ruins, which were later taken over by the Chesterfield Conservation Commission, which added trails around the structure and renamed the forest after Madame Sherri.Update as of July 2021: Sadly, the stairs have partially collapsed.',\n",

In total, it takes over five weeks to build the castle complex, due in large part to the amount of structures that comprise it. Although Finland gets its fair share of snow, builders actually use seawater-converting snow machines to create the powerful material for their snowy medieval fortifications.Along with the castle walls, which are over twelve feet high, the area also features a hotel, art gallery, and chapel, where some people even come from across the globe to get married. Each portion of the castle is lit with colorful lights that add splendor to the naturally etherealice walls. Many artists come to lend their talents to the castle by creating ice sculptures throughout the waterside structure as well.Situated right on the Bothnian Bay, the castle rises up like a majestic fairytale world in the cold Finnish winter. In many ways, the Snow Castle makes the long, dark northern winters a bit more bearable for the small town of Kemi.Although the main components of the castle are consistent each winter, the Snow Castle melts in the spring and is constantly built in a new configuration. During the last 15 years, the castle has been anywhere from 13,000-20,000 square meters and has even reached three stories high.

The infamous Romanian ruler was immortalized as the inspiration for Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel, “Dracula,”. The novel is believed to be inspired by theRomanian folklore lady serial killer Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Thanks to this loose link to the famous vampire, Bran Castle is popularly known in the region and beyond as “Dracula’s Castle.”Bran Castle was built between 1377 and 1388 atop a strategic site overlooking a heavily trafficked mountain pass between Transylvania and Wallachia, the land over which Vlad the Impaler ruled in the 15th century. Also known as Vlad III Dracula, the ruler is widely believed to be the inspiration for Count Dracula due to his historic bloodlust. He liked to torture people and would impale his enemies on the battlefield to deter his other enemies. During invasions, he was also known to use the scorched-earth policy, a military strategy that consists of destroying any possible resource that the enemy could use by poisoning water supplies and burning crops.Although the famous Wallachian ruler might have passed several times near Bran, there is no historical document attesting that he ever visited it. His visits to Transylvania were usually related to the boyars of Brașov. After his first reign, when he was sent into exile, he wanted to settle in Brașov, but John Hunyadi forbade them to provide him with shelter.The castleis owned by the descendants of Queen Marie, to whom it was given 1920 as a token of appreciation for her efforts to unify Romania. After her death, Bran Castle was inherited by her daughter, Princess Ileana, who ran it as a hospital during World War II. In 1948 the castle was seized by the Communist regime, but it was returned to Dominic von Habsburg, Princess Ileana’s son, in 2006.Currently, Bran is open as a museum, largely devoted to Queen Marie of Romania. The castle is also a popular location for Halloween events, like the 2016 competition to win the chance to stay in the castle Halloween night, retracing the steps of Jonathan Harker from the opening pages of Bram Stoker’s novel.BramStoker never visited central Europe, and there are other castles with more solid claims on Dracula’s legend, but underground passages and ancient weapons and armor, and not to mention all the creepy sounds the medieval building makes, make the Bran Castle an experience worthy of the vampire’s name.',\n",

       "  'Deep within the vast Prague Castle complex is an easily overlooked feature that is quite literally a window to a devastating moment in history: the 1618 defenestration (the act of throwing someone out a window as a means of execution) that led to Europe’s Thirty Years’ War.The origins of the war lie in an entanglement of complexities that are often simplified as a conflict between Protestants and Catholics. When the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II attempted to make Catholicism the sole religion of the empire, the Protestants of Bohemia (modern Czechia) protested the suppression of their religion. In anger, Bohemian nobles in Prague flung two representatives of Ferdinand out of a window of the Royal Palace.The flingees survived their fall with only minor aches and pains, being cushioned by the flocculence of a manure pile, although Catholics claimed that a divine miracle saved them. Then, with significant chips on their shoulders, Ferdinand’s representatives reported their assault by the bunch of tossers, and the Thirty Years’ War began.As unique as defenestration of one’s enemies may sound, this was actually the second historically significant window-tossing event in the city. The first Defenestration of Prague occurred in 1419 when an angry mob threw a judge out of the second story window of the New Town Hall, starting a rather shady tradition. Yet a third defenestration may also have occurred in 1948 when Communists were accused of assassinating Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk by similar means.Although a reference to the Thirty Years’ War is unlikely to yield much reaction from most Americans, to central Europe it was a catastrophe of epic proportions, with consequences that reverberate through today. Fought between 1618 and 1648, estimates of fatalities range from 5 million to 11 million people, and it all began from a fit of jealousy in the Czech Office of the Old Royal Palace. If you happen to sashay into the Prague Castle and glaze over at its immensity, take time to visit the famous window for a moment of reflection.',\n",

North America is not a continent that has a ton of “castle cred,” mostly because modern North American history (dating from the arrival of white settlers) is, for the most part, a history either of colonies or democracies. However, there is one structure on the North American continent that can truly claim to be a castle, Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City.Chapultepec has the rather dubious distinction of being the only castle within North America to ever house actual sovereigns. It was originally constructed in 1725 on the orders of the Viceroy Bernardo de Gálvez, and was meant to be a large manor house for the Viceroy, who was the commander-in-chief of the Spanish colony, New Spain. During the Mexican War of Independence the castle was abandoned, and remained in a state of dereliction for several decades. It was eventually refurbished and turned into a Military Academy. It was in this capacity that the castle served as the site of the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican-American War in 1847. It was here according to folklore that six (possibly fictional) teenage cadets died defending the castle with one of the boys, Juan Escutia, wrapping himself in the Mexican flag and jumping to his death from the battlements to avoid the dishonor of it being captured by the American invaders.With the rise of the Second Mexican Empire in 1864 the castle became the official residence of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Empress Carlota. Maximilian, while in name and title the Emperor of Mexico, was in fact an Austrian prince of the Habsburg dynasty who was not ethnically Mexican at all, having been offered the crown by Mexican monarchists who were puppets of the French who sought to add Mexico to their empire. During this period the castle began to take on its current floor plan, with Maximilian hiring multiple architects to re-design the castle in the neo-classical style which was popular at the time.Unfortunately for Maximilian his reign, and with it the Second Mexican Empire, were brought to an abrupt halt only four years later in 1867 when the French were defeated and he was shot by firing squad along with several of his most loyal followers. He had been given the opportunity by Juarez to return to Europe but had decided to stay on due to his mothers harsh insistence on him staying and dying with dignity rather than return as a “coward” unworthy of the Hapsburg name. With the establishment of the Mexican Republic under Benito Juárez Cahpultepec again began to fall into disuse and disrepair.Currently the castle is the seat of National Museum of Cultures, which was formerly known as the Museum of Natural History. It was established as such by Lázaro Cárdenas in 1939. In this capacity it is open to visitors who can come and tour both the castle itself and the various collections it now houses. Through the past decades it has become a favorite location of movie directors appearing in both Robert Aldrich’s Vera Cruz and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo and Juliet.',\n",

When it was first built in the city park, it was made of cardboard as a temporary exhibit for the Hungarian millennial exhibition in 1896, but the beautiful castle was so popular, they decided to make it a permanent fixture. Stone and brick, statues and thousands of agricultural artifacts later, the fake castle is a proud feature of Budapest’s City Park today.When the castle was finished in 1908, it became the home of the Hungarian Agricultural Museum. A trip to the museum is worth being inside the lovely folly of a castle, but a climb up the imposing stone staircase reveals something altogether more exciting.Hundreds of antlers, horns, hooves, and fur. Stuffed birds and mounted bears. Cutlery with horn handles carved into foxes. Antler broaches, antler chandeliers, and antler chairs. It is known as “The Hall of Hunting.” With beautiful vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows, along with the fact that the Agricultaral Museum is often empty, this top floor feels like the church of a long lost deer deity. Echoed footsteps and hushed whispers lend a quiet respect to these relics of the hunt.It’s a wonder that the Agricultural Museum of Budapest has anything at all. The collection has been destroyed not once, but twice since its opening 100 years ago. WWII came through, and about 10 years later, just as the collection was coming back together, the freedom fighters of the Hungarian uprising of 1956 tore through the hall of antlers and taxidermy displays. But through many donations and loving attention, this shrine of the dead animal has been restored to its former glory.The museum also features exhibits on the history of Hungarian agriculture from the beginning to present, domestication of animals, forestry, fishing, and plant life.',\n",

It can be found just outside of the city of Barcelonaand is little-known by most people, even many locals who live in the city.The fortress-like castle is located next to the historic Colonia Güell, a purpose-built village for the workers of a nearby textile mill. The castle was partially destroyed in the Catalan Civil War in 1224. It has sat abandoned for centuries.These days the ruins serve as a place where you can explore and capture some great photos. Many of the walls inside the castle have been eroded over time, but there are still distinct hallways and rooms to discover.The second floor is intact and offers a great view over the surrounding former factory village of Colonia Güell.The village’s church was designed by the famous architect Antoni Gaudi and, like Castillo Torre Salvana, is not very well known. The church can be seen from the castle’s second-floor windows, so you can experience two of Barcelona’s hidden gems at the same time.',\n",

This picturesque and defensively sound structure was built upon and rebuilt over the centuries by a succession of royals and wealthy families, but it was not until the Baroness Katharina Elisabeth von Wechsler took control of the estate in the 17th century that the castle gained its current identity.The baroness was known across the Styrian region as a strong-willed woman in the male-dominated society who would go to extraordinary lengths to protect her legacy and her castle. During her residence, the estate saw a large expansion into its current opulent state, with 108 rooms, five gates, and elaborate ornamentation. Unfortunately von Wechsler’s lavish lifestyle was sadly mirrored by the fate of one of her handmaidens. Katharina Paldauff, who came to be known as the “Flower Witch,” was a victim of the Styrian witch hunts that took place from 1673-1675. Accused of “bad weather sorcery,” the woman was killed, displaying the continued persecution of the times. The castle stayed with the baroness’ family through the centuries and both she and her murdered servant are honored by a pair of museums on the estate, one honoring the famous women of the region and the other exploring the history of witchcraft and sorcery.',\n",

After its capture by Portuguese forces, the fort remained a seat of power in the region for several hundred years before being partially abandoned and reinhabited by the local Jewish population. They were eventually forced out of the structure and it was completely abandoned by the early 16th century where it gradually fell into disrepair and decay through fire, earthquake, and general neglect.In 1840, King Ferdinand II began repairs on the ancient fortress, as to add to the expanding palatial gardens of nearby Pena Palace. Walls and towers were restored and the surrounding hills were planted with trees, vines, and shrubs while paths and gardens were additionally incorporated into the renaissance styled romantic landscape that the King envisioned. Further restoration work continued into the mid-20th century and archeological digs began excavating ruins from the time of the mountain’s original owners, from 5,000 BC to today.Today, the fortress is once again majestic in its stately splendor, impossible to miss from every angle in the magical and venerable town of Sintra. It is open nearly every day of the year for a small fee to visitors willing to explore the stabilized ruins and take in the jaw-dropping (and stomach-dropping) views of the region below.

The building’s bricks were made by nearby Folsom and San Quentin inmates and shipped via rail to Ione, in California’s Sierra Foothills, where the castle was built.The state legislature had ordered construction of the building to serve as a juvenile rehabilitation correctional facility. By 1894 the castle was complete and the Preston School of Industry was opened. At the military-styled school wards spent half their days in school and the other half learning a trade that could support them after their release. The facility served as home to the school until 1960 when it was moved to newer nearby buildings.For the next forty years the castle remained abandoned, until 2001 when a fifty-year lease was given to The Preston Castle Foundation. The foundation has since been working to preserve and restore the castle. The building has been named as a California Historical Landmark (#867) and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NPS-75000422).It has long been said that the castle is haunted and it has been investigated by a variety of ghost hunters. Several deaths occurred at the castle throughout the years, but it is believed to be haunted by Anna Corbin, a housekeeper who was found beaten to death in 1950. For those hoping to experience the paranormal, overnight ghost tours are offered for $100. Basic tours are also offered almost everySaturday, plus some Tuesdays, during the months of April through December.Future beat-hero Neal Cassidy supposedly “discovered literature” while as a ward at the school.

With a series of five wooden arches, the bridge spans the Nishiki River. It is located at the foot of Mt. Yokotama, which is topped with the famous Iwakuni Castle. The castle was built in 1601 and overlooked a series of wooden bridges, all destroyed by spring floods before the Kintai bridge was completed.The elegance of the bridge’s form inspired the name Kintai, which means gold brocade sash because of a similarity to the traditional Nishiki obi for a kimono. It has been rebuilt several times since it was initially constructed even though it was thought to be indestructible, most recently in 1951 after a typhoon. The bridge is made up of five arches standing atop four stone piers as well as two wood piers that sit on the dry riverbed where the bridge begins and ends. For almost three hundred years, the bridge stood without the use of nails that you would find in more traditional construction. It stood because all of its many pieces were very carefully fitted together. Sheets of copper were laid over the main wooden parts of the bridge after it was built.Kintai remains Japan’s most famous bridge. Tourists cross it on foot to visit samurai family-owned houses in Kikko Park, and take a cable car to the heights to visit Iwakuni Castle, and to see a breathtaking panorama of Iwakuni and the Seto Sea. Declared a National Treasure in 1922, the area including both the bridge and the castle is one of the country’s most popular destinations, especially during the Cherry Blossom festival in the spring.',\n",

Though long lasting, the original was deemed unfit by Marquis Ferdinando Ximenes Panciatichi, who in 1853 undertook a complete rebuild of the site.This historically overlooked marquis retreatedfrom Florence’s increasingly toxicpolitical climate, and decided to hire artisans and construct his ideal retreat in the form of what is now known as Sammezzano Castle.

The Romans built two lighthouses there, with one of these “pharos” still standing, although it’s now part of the castle itself.When William the Conqueror won the Battle of Hastings in the 11th century he lined the shore with fortifications, bringing the first century AD lighthouse into the construction of Dover Castle. Although in the 14th century, stonework was added to the pharos, you can still find its ancient remains embedded in the fortress. Dover Castle is known as a major military center for England, but it’s just as significant now for having one of the few surviving Roman lighthouses.Beneath the castle is another area of intrigue: the tunnels. The multi-level labyrinth cut into the soft white chalk was built to hold 2,000 troops during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon never did arrive, and the tunnels were abandoned. Then World War II came around and they were enlisted as a strategic air raid shelter as well as a hospital and command center. You can still find the old operating theater there.Currently, the 70 acres of Dover Castle are operated as a tourist site by English Heritage.

The beer is rich in vitamins and calcium, and it is said that sitting in it is good for the skin and helps cure open wounds and psoriasis.The pools started back in 2005 when the old fermentation cellar of the 700-year-old castle became obsolete, so they turned the area into a beer spa.

In 1880 two prospectors, Charles B. Culver, and W.F. Coxhead, discovered silver in the Castle Creek Valley. In his greedy furor Coxhead promoted the area as Castle Forks City (changed to Ashcroft in 1882) back in the mining town of Leadville, hoping to bring other prospectors and businesspeople to the area. Meanwhile Culver recruited 23 other prospectors on site and when Coxhead returned, the 25 of them laid out city streets and constructed a courthouse in just two weeks.By 1885, six hotels and twenty saloons had sprung up, and the town was now home to over 3,500 people. However, as with so many towns in the boom times of Western mining, things declined rapidly from there. The early promise of a railroad passing from Ashcroft to Crested Butte never came about. In addition, the ore deposits, initially turning out 14,000 ounces of silver per ton, turned out to be shallow and were quickly depleted. 1884 had produced another rich ore vain in nearby Aspen, and by the end of 1885 only 100 residents remained in Ashcroft. Into the 20th Century, only a few men stayed in the dwindling town asmine work thinned out. Mostly they fished, hunted, and drank at the local bar.The 1930s briefly brought new life to the town as winter sports rose in popularity and the Highland-Bavarian Lodge was built as a planned ski resort. After one of the founders of the resort died in combat in World War II, the town was leased to the U.S. Military, seeing use from the 10th Mountain Division for mountaineering training. After the end of the war, it was given over the the U.S. Forest Service.Ashcroft saw limited activity from then on, until 1974, when the Aspen Historical Society took interest. They succeeded in having Ashcroft added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and it remains as a terrifically preserved ghost town and cautionary reminder of the fleeting rewards of greed.',\n",

He then built the Grand Staircase to help him carry river sand up the hill to make concrete, with which he built first his house, then a grand castle inspired by those of Spain, and installed the oldest hydro-electric dam in North Queensland. Among the park’s features include the theater, foyer and refreshment rooms within the castle, a fountain built by Paronella, and the concrete benches he built next to a beautiful waterfall.After a decade of labor, the park opened in 1935. José Paronella continued to labor tirelessly on the park, fixing it after a bad flood in 1946, until his death in 1948. He had been laboring on the park for the last 21 years. Without his tireless energy, it became difficult to upkeep the park and over the years, the park was badly damaged by natural disasters; floods, fires and a cyclone decimated it. Though José’s children and grandchildren continued to own and care for the park for many years, by 1977 the park was sold. After a fire struck in 1979, and Cyclone Winifred in 1986, the park was closed for good.But, in 1993, the Park was purchased by Mark and Judy Evans and reopened to the public. The Evans see their role as that of maintaining and preserving the great work of art created by José Paronella. The park now operates tours throughout the day, as well as a spectacular evening tour. They recommend you spend at least three hours exploring both the natural and man-made wonders, from the grand staircase and castle to the waterfall and magnificent flowers.Paronella Park has won numerous tourism awards and was listed as a National Trust in 1997. Additionally, in 2008, they updated the hydro-electric system, which generates all the power for the park and puts power back into the grid for neighboring towns.To seal this Hollywood ending, Australian director Ben Hackworth plans to make a feature film of the history of the park.Admission to the park includes a night stay in their caravan park, annual admission, guided tours, and two maps.',\n",

In the 16th-century, a severe drought spurred the locals to create a dam, creating the lake that submerged the lower portions of the lodge.During the 18th century, the water-locked lodge was renovated and the lake area was expanded. For a great deal of the temple’s history, visitors were able to take gondolas across the lake waters to visit the historic faux-palace.

But if you’re the sort who seeks out a Lynchian heart of darkness wherever you go, look no further than Carleton Avenue S.Here stands the Georgetown Castle, a three-story mansion with a tragic and tawdry past. The castle, a former brothel, somehow manages to look demure, set back from the street and sheltered by unusually lush gardens on either side.Come closer, and a metal placard appears, seemingly out of nowhere, to offer tantalizing details about the mansion’s history. Architecture buffs will recognize the building’s Queen Anne style, resplendent as it is with overhanging eaves, mismatched gables, and overlapping textures.Of course, the castle’s spooky aura is more than just cosmetic. The abode was built in 1902 by a wealthy blackjack dealer named Peter Gessner. But poor Gessner didn’t get much of a chance to appreciate it (while he was still alive, that is).It’s said the second floor is haunted by Gessner himself, who only lasted a year after moving into his castle. In 1903, he died by suicide. There were rumors of foul play, but Seattle papers reported it as a case of lovesickness over his young wife Lizzie, who had recently left him for a chicken farmer.Before his death, Gessner made use of Georgetown’s location on the outskirts of Seattle to run a brothel and gambling saloon. It was a sordid start that would prove hard to scrub away. By the 1920s, the place was once again functioning as a brothel. Decades later, the castle was finally turned into a somewhat respectable boardinghouse, though it would remain haunted, quite literally, by its untoward beginnings.The castle’s second-most famous ghost, after Gessner, is said to be a disgruntled former employee. She’s a hazy figure at best, the details of her life and death obscured by a century of local gossip. In one version of the tale, she’s inexplicably strangled by a magician. Another, more likely story sees her shot dead by an abusive pimp. One moment, her name is Sarah. The next, it’s Mary. Today, the ghost has flowing red hair and a white nightgown. Tomorrow, it’s dark hair and kohl-rimmed eyes.Then there’s the story of an unwed mother, perhaps Gessner’s niece, locked in the castle’s tower and forever separated from her baby, a truly infernal infant whose wails rise up nightly from the garden weeds. Some say that it was a john or a pimp who murdered the newborn and buried it on the property. Others say it was Gessner himself.These days, the Georgetown Castle is privately owned and well maintained. The exterior is painted a pinkish orange and trimmed in chartreuse: a dish of ripe melon glistening at some hellish garden party.

Johnson was lured to Death Valley by promises of a (fraudulent) gold mine investment with one Walter Scott, known as “Death Valley Scotty”. His wife’s insistence on him staying for his health kept him there.Scotty, born in Kentucky and once a member of Buffalo Bill Cody’s Wild West Show, is best described by Richard E. Lingenfelter: “Death Valley Scotty was a ham actor, a conscienceless con man, an almost pathological liar, and a charismatic bullslinger. For all his ruby faced bluster and bravo, he had a ready smile, a colorful gift of gab, and a ingratiating manner that disarmed even his sharpest critics. But behind the engaging showman could be sensed a furtiveness in his steel blue eyes, and a tension that sometimes set his jaw to granite. He was an insatiable attention seeker, a reckless publicity hound, willing to say or do anything for one more moment in the limelight.”Tired of their modest cabin, the Johnsons began building the Castle - Albert’s dream home, Bessie’s desert retreat, and Scotty’s con-man hide out. Construction boomed and busted with the economic swing from the Roaring 20s to the Depression 30’s. Johnson began construction in 1922, investing $1.4 million dollars in to the project. While the castle was under construction, he agreed to act as Scotty’s “banker”, and Scotty in turn told potential investors from the city that he was building a $2 million dollar home funded by his gold mine – the same fraudulent gold mine he had conned Johnson into investing in.However this con came up short with the abrupt end of the Roaring 20s in 1929’s stock market crash. President Hoover created the Death Valley National Monument in 1930, encompassing the land Johnson was building on but did not own. Johnson’s insurance company went belly-up in 1933. Although Johnson was eventually able to buy the land under his castle, he was unable to complete its construction.The Johnsons retired to Hollywood, visiting the castle from time to time. With them came hoards of tourists who flocked to the castle-turned-hotel in hopes of catching a glimpse of the famed “Death Valley Scotty”. Upon his death, Johnson willed the castle to the Gospel Foundation, who later sold it to the Death Valley National Park in 1970 for $850,000. “Death Valley Scotty” remains near “his” castle, watching from his burial site on the hillside above it.Today, Scotty’s Castle is still a tourist destination in the Death Valley National Park. Visitors can climb around and explore the still unfinished castle or take guided tours, underground tours, and on special occasions enjoy a murder mystery night at the castle.Update as of July 2022: The location is currently closed indefinitely.',\n",

       "  'Craig-E-Clair Castle, alternatively called Dundas Castle, is nestled away like a decaying fairy tale in the enshrouding forests of the Catskill Mountains.Even today, a fair amount of mystery and intrigue surrounds the castle. With varying dates attributed to its construction, no one seems to be certain of its history. What truth is reasonably certain, however, is that the structure was originally a summer lodge built by Bradford Lee Gilbert in the early 1880s. The name of Craig-E-Clair is said to have come from Gilbert’s wife, a Scottish native who was reminded of a small town by the name of Craig-E-Clare in Scotland. After Gilbert passed away in 1911, the land and lodge were sold to Maurice Sternbeck, before coming into the possession of Ralph Wurts-Dundas in 1915. Dundas began construction of the castle soon after, but never lived to see it completed, dying in 1921 while the estate was in the final stages of construction.Then, in 1922, a year after Dundas’s death, his wife Josephine Wurts-Dundas, was committed to a sanitarium, without ever having lived in the castle. After Anna’s commitment, her only child by Dundas, Muriel Harmer Wurts-Dundas, inherited the fortune that had passed to her mother from her father. She soon had a large portion of the fortune stolen by the castle caretakers, who were acting as her guardians at the time. Eventually, she went on to get married, and moved to England, where she departed with her husband on an expedition to find “St. John’s Gold.” The expedition fell apart when the couple fired the historians and scientists helping in the search, and hired a mystic with a willow wand instead. Eventually, Muriel’smental stability wasquestioned. She was soon committed, just as her mother had been.The enigmatic keep passed from the hands of the Dundas family and into various short-term uses. For a time it was used as a summer camp for children, before being purchased by the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Masons, an African-American Masons group from Manhattan, as a retreat. Eventually, they gave up on even that use, and though the Prince Hall Masons still own the structure (leading to the sometimes title of the Mason’s Castle), it now sits abandoned, rotting, and brooding in its wood, subject to the cruel hands of nature and vandalism.The curious history of the place, the tradition of every endeavor put upon it of failing, and its eventual abandonment have given rise to many legends about the house. Some say it is haunted by the ghost of JosephineDundas, who they claim was locked in an upstairs room. Others say that the three heart-shaped ponds on the property filled with blood on the full moon. There is no evidence that anyone was ever locked in any of the rooms, indeed, according to the history available, no one ever lived there for any amount of time at all. The fact, however, cannot deny that the site has an atmosphere that can stir the imagination of anyone who sees the castle, alone in its mountains, with no company but the silent trees.Update as of 2021: The castle is currently under construction to become a hotel. The primary owner predicts it should be finished by the summer of 2022.',\n",

       "  'The Kinks, Bauhaus, and Andy Warhol have all paid homage to Béla Lugosi. And now his likeness adorns a Hungarian castle.In 2003, German artist Hartmut Zech made a bust of Béla Lugosi. In July that year, when he and some friends took a trip to Budapest, he brought it along in hopes of finding a home for the sculpture. In City Park, he noticed an empty alcove on a corner of the Vajdahunyad Castle, and late that night, with help from his friends, installed the statue on a ledge about 10 feet up the facade.Vajdahunyad Castle is an architectural collage built to pay homage to several landmark buildings in Hungary’s 1,000-year history. It was built in 1896 for the Millennial Exhibition to celebrate the anniversary of the Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin in 895.The Hungarian-American actor Béla Lugosiwas born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Lugos,Kingdom of Hungary(nowLugoj,Romania). He’s known for portraying the eponymous character in Dracula on Broadway in 1927 and in the 1931 film adaptation (both loosely based on Bram Stoker’s novel) as well as his later work in Ed Wood’s films, including the cult classic Plan 9 From Outer Space.The Lugosi bust was the fifth sculpture that Zech “gifted” to a foreign country. The first was a Jim Morrison bust he hid in a stroller and pushed into the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where the singer is buried. That one came down within days. Other statues went up in different places, with varying degrees of permission and success. But the bust of Béla Lugosi remains—an additional bit of Hungarian history for the castle’s visitors to celebrate.',\n",

The home was so secluded that Knapp had to build a new road just to have the place built. However the rich digs would not last long.

As a result, the building is surrounded by towering trees.Facing the blue green waters of Emerald Bay on Lake Tahoe, the building was her summer home and retreat, designed for entertaining her friends. Across the waters on Fanette Island, she had a small stone tea house built, which now stands in picturesque ruin.Today the home is part of the Emerald Bay state park, and is open to tours during the summer months, with most of the furnishings still in place from the era of the original occupancy.

       "  'Inspired by the legendary botanical gardens in Padua, an English duchess created this garden dedicated entirely to flora which are deadly and/or narcotic.Behind big black gates, the carefully curated garden contains about 100 legendary killers like Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Strychnos nux-vomica (strychnine), and Conium maculatum (hemlock). Guides explain their deadly properties while keeping ne’er-do-wells and curious children away from the plants, warning them: “Do not touch any of the plants, don’t even smell them. There are plants here that can kill you.”The duchess herself is an unlikely patron. Until 1995, she was just Jane Percy, mother of four. Then in 1995, her husband unexpectedly became the twelfth Duke of Northumberland following his brother’s untimely death, and the next thing they knew they had a castle to deal with. As she inspected her newly inherited digs and expansive gardens, much of which had been meticulously designed by the famous landscape designer Capability Brown, she came across an overgrown, neglected section. Formal gardens had been planted in that spot by the first duke in 1750, and it passed through several incarnations until World War II, when it was converted from a place of Italian ornamental splendor into a victory garden of vegetables. By 1950, it had closed. She decided to restore it, not to its former glory, but into a new, modern garden.The poison garden opened in 2005 as just a portion of the ambitious 14-acre new gardens. Wanting in part to hark back to old apothecary’s gardens, the duchess shied away from planting healing medicinals and instead sought out hard-to-get deadly poisons. Also included in the gardens are narcotic plants like opium poppies, cannabis, magic mushrooms, datura, and tobacco. Many of these required special government permission to grow. Because the danger posed by poisonous plants is very real (some can kill or sicken just through touch), some plants are caged, and the garden is secured each evening behind gates under a 24-hour security watch.Other parts of the garden include an enormous multi-level treehouse and a bamboo labyrinth. You may also find the looming Alnwick Castle strangely familiar, having seen it stand in as Hogwarts in the first two Harry Potter films.The gardens are planned in several phases, some of which are still incomplete—funds in the millions of pounds have not been as forthcoming lately.',\n",

While “Beardslee City” didn’t last, the family continued to find success and in 1860, construction began on the castle that would become their legacy. The small three-story manse was modeled after the rough stone and rounded parapets of historic Irish castles, just as though someone plopped one of them down in the middle of the New York woods.As further generations of the family took over the grounds they expanded the services and eventually brought electricity to the remote area. Unfortunately a fire in 1919 completely destroyed the interior of the building leaving only the replica-Irish shape of the place. The blaze was suspected to be arson, although it was never confirmed. It was eventually rebuilt, but sold out of the family just decades later.Under new ownership, the castle soon began operating as a restaurant and party space known as “The Manor,” and then “Beardslee Manor,” using the atmospheric castle interior to drum up some business-driving drivel about ghosts that haunted the halls. This era of the castle also ended in a 1989 fire that once again destroyed much of the interior, although this time the space was abandoned altogether for a number of years before finally being restored.Today the castle still operates as a restaurant and venue, lightly hinting at its ghostly hauntings, although it seems as though guests to the eccentric castle should be more afraid of fire.',\n",

The official starting date is January 5th, lasting until February 15th, though weather permitting, the exhibitions often open a week earlier and run until March.Each year has a different ‘theme,’ past themes including the Beijing Olympics, Chinese tourist sites, ‘Prosperous China and High-Flying Longjiang’, and ‘Friendship between China and Russia.’ The Great Wall (doubling as an ice slide), pyramids, sphinxes, terra cotta warriors, a Disney castle, towering pagodas, enormous Buddhas, and gardens are only a handful of the creative sculptures and carvings to have been a part of the Harbin Festival.It is a competitive event, with teams coming from all over the world-the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Africa, France etc. During the nights of the month-long festival, lights from inside and outside of the sculptures brilliantly illuminate a variety of architectural styles, fanciful castles, mythological and historical figures, ice lanterns and slides.Fireworks light up the sky on various evenings while the dazzling multicolored ice sculptures light up the entire ground. The ice is procured from the surface of the frozen Songhua River, then intricately carved, many of the sculptures receiving a douse of deionized water to produce an entirely transparent look.

Not much is known about the history of the earlier castle, the likelihood is that it was a victim of the 14th century Welsh rebellion, a forgettable architectural casualty. That is untilJohn Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, took an interest in the site in 1871. He contracted his architect Mr. Burges to take it on as their next ambitious reconstruction project, with big plans to turn the formerly functional castle into a ravishing architectural beauty.While not exactly historically accurate, the restoration can surely be described as storybook whimsy. Conical towers rise above a fanciful drawbridge, while inside birds and butterflies grace guilder trellises. An ornate chimney piece depicting The Three Fates doling out the thread of life above an exquisite fireplace. Bedrooms and ballrooms, all draped in the opulence ofHigh Victorian Gothic style.Burges died in 1881, but the restoration continued.

Dublin, was built from sacred stones culled from the nearby Bearna Dhearg (or “ringfort”), but little is really known for certain about the structure today. Because of the “sacred stones” story, Puck’s – an English derivative of the Gaelic “púca” or “pooka” meaning ghost or spirit – is said to be haunted.Many languages have similar words to “púca” – in Iceland there is “puki”; “piskey” in Cornish (that’s where we get the word “pixie”); “pwcca” in Welsh (try saying that ten times fast); and “pawkey” in Scottish. It’s where Shakespeare got the name “Puck”, meaning “fairie”, for A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Whether it’s a curse, or a haunting, or just neglect, Puck’s Castle sits today in silent ruins, mostly visited by grazing cattle and the occasional fence-hopper. The castle dates to sometime around 1500, and as a fortified homestead it was part of a number of defensive buildings similarly erected in the area from that period.Rathmichael, southeast of Dublin, is a suburb in ruins; or rather, a suburb WITH ruins. In addition to the Castle there are also church ruins that are near the ruins of the old ringfort (ringforts are common in Ireland, being medieval circular fortified settlements). The church may (or may not – that’s another mystery) have been built in dedication to a saint named “Mac Táil” (that’s right – “Michael”) so we get the Irish name of “Ráth Mhic Táil,” which would translate to “ringfort of Mac Táil,” or the English variation: Rathmichael.There is no way to know for sure about this either, but the castle may also have given James II (who lived from 1633 to 1701) a waystation as he retreated during the Battle of The Boyne in 1690. He eventually retreated all the way back to France, and never came back to Ireland to let us know for sure.So while much of the history of the castle is shrouded in mystery, there is also very little of the castle left intact. But inside you can see evidence of the stone stairwell and the fireplace – most everything else is long gone and crumbling. The grounds are usually behind a locked fence, but it’s not far off Puck’s Castle Lane, so you can visit – but may need to sense the Púca’s spirit through some chain link.',\n",

However, few motivators are as strong as the sorrow of lost love. When Latvian Ed Leedskalnin was jilted by his sweet sixteen the day before their wedding, it was to send him on a mysterious and marvelous path of creation.The Coral Castle, originally dubbed Rock Gate Park by Leedskalnin, is perhaps the most mysterious of all the world’s self-built castles. After his heartbreak, Ed moved to the US and eventually to Florida where he began working on his home and great monument to lost love. Born in 1887 to a family of Latvian stone masons, the 5-foot 100-pound Ed used his inherited skills to move blocks of Oolitic Limestone (fossilized coral) over 25 feet tall and weighing over 30 tons. This makes some of the stones in the Coral Castle taller than those in Stonehenge and heavier than the heaviest stone in the great pyramid of Giza.The castle contains many wonders including a sundial, a stone rocking chair, a 500-pound heart-shaped stone table (a “Valentine” for his lost love), and a 9-ton gate made to spin with just a light touch. Ed was secretive, working on the castle mostly at night, and keeping to a policy of letting no one see his working methods. This led to much speculation that Ledeskalnin used some magical or ancient power to move the giant stones. Perhaps what is more impressive than imagined powers is that this small Latvian man spent his entire life cutting and moving these massive stones as a monument to his lost “Sweet Sixteen.”',\n",

Neither of these came to pass however.The site was eventually purchased by Thomas R. Post who began extensive renovations on the long dormant castle. However in 2004 a fire struck the construction site, ruining much of the progress that had been made. Despite the setback, Post redoubled his efforts on the property, sinking huge amounts of money into fixing the existing structure and adding new amenities such as a library, ball room, and full garden.In 2008, Castle Post was opened as a luxury event location and bed and breakfast. However for most Versailles, Kentucky locals will likely continue to remember it as the enigmatic castle at the top of the hill.  ',\n",

Rising 90 feet from the valley floor, it could only be accessed by ladders, which, when pulled away, provided safety for the tribe from any intruder—man or beast—with unsavory motives.There was a time when visitors were permitted inside to have a look around, but limestone is soft, and thousands of stomping feet are destructive, so within a few years of its protected status as a National Monument, the public was kept out, in order to preserve it.

Prisoners in the jail tended to be petty offenders such as beggars and drunks from around the city. The medieval European design of the fortress was not only considered trendy at the time but it also gave the site an air of imposing authority.After a few decades in operation the prison closed its doors for the first time, passing over to over a dozen new owners over the ensuing decades. It was not until 1972 that the castle was shuttered for the last time and it was abandoned.Left empty, the crumbling structure began simply a local oddity sitting just off the street. Graffiti artists soon found their way in and began tagging up the walls. In recent years, plans have been put forth to turn the workhouse into a community center and venue, but nothing has begun yet. For now the walls remained decorated by the same minor offenders that would once have been incarcerated between them. ',\n",

A frontierswoman, alcoholic, Indian fighter, sometimes prostitute, she came to Castle to open a restaurant in the 1890s.

Although an underground railway exists to deliver goods to the castle from the harbor, its steep grading does not allow for passengers and is not even open to the public for viewing.One of 43 tidal islands within walking distance of mainland Britain, St Michael’s is (if historians are correct) one of the earliest locations identified in text in all of Western Europe. Believed to be mentioned by both Pliny the Elder’sNaturalis Historiaas well as Greek historianDiodorus Siculus’Bibliotheca historica, both scholars had access to the now non-existent texts of Pytheas, the ancient Greek geographer thought to have visited the island in 4th century BC. (It is still argued that the Diodorus Siculus reference to “Ictis,” a tin-trading center thought to be St Michael’s, is actually Looe Island, off of the coast of Cornwall).St. Michael’s has harbored its share of monastic buildings, abbeys, churches, and escapes for pilgrims and devotees. Battered by earthquakes, floods, and war, structures have come and gone, been rebuilt, and in one case, revealed the remains of an anchorite who had been sealed up in a chamber under the church in a makeshift tomb.In the present day, the island is home to a 15th-century chapel, a village made up of eight houses, an island cemetery acting as a final resting place for island residents and drowned sailors, and a castle, residence of Lord St Laven, John St Aubyn.The ancestral seat of the St Aubyn family, the island and castle was given to the National Trust in 1954 but remains the home of the family, who retained a 999-year lease.Tours of the island and parts of the castle are available, and there is a museum with several artifacts that pertain to the island’s long, colorful history.',\n",

       "  'Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, a Canadian soldier and financier, gained immense wealth from founding the Toronto Electric Light Company in 1883, which brought electricity to the streetlights of Canada’s largest city. Business boomed – soon he was the chairman of 21 companies, owned railroads, generated electricity from Niagara Falls, and was knighted for his military service.His monopoly grew for a full 28 years until 1911, when everything started going downhill.Pellatt, who had been intrigued by castles since visiting Europe in his teenage years, decided to use his fortune of $17 million (modern-day $412 million) to build a personal château in the middle of Toronto. This 98-room castle, named Casa Loma, cost nearly 2 million man-hours and $3.5 million to build, including a whopping $50,000 a year for 40 live-in staff and $250,000 just to put the names of his horses in 18-carat gold — and that’s all in 1911 dollars.In retrospect, it’s no surprisethat Pellatt went bankrupt pretty quickly. By 1920, the Canadian electricity market was made publicly owned (destroying his main source of income), and the economy was in a slump from the end of World War I. Pellatt owed over a million dollars to the Home Bank of Canada and was in so much debt that he sold everything he could, for an average of 17% of its original cost. Garden vases for $16, two brass sundials for $25, and a $75,000 pipe organ for $40 (despite the auctioneer giving it a rendition of “Auld Lang Syne”). To sum it up, in the words of Canadian politician Charles Henderson, “a Persian rug for the price of a doormat.” Sadly for Pellatt, he eventually had to sell his palace and move out.Nowadays, Casa Loma is owned by the city and has become a museum and tourist attraction for visitors to Toronto. Although Pellatt sold its bear skin rugs, bronze buffalo head, and the grand marble fountain featuring statues of children holding up a dolphin, Casa Loma still holds many of its original attributes. This includes the 10,000-book library, the plant-filled conservatory complete with a marble floor and a stained glass ceiling, the 60-foot-tall Great Hall with wooden chandeliers and sculpted figures on its pillars, the beautiful gardens abounding with flowers, and the mahogany stables built with a Spanish tile floor suited for the hooves of the horses. The castle had three indoor bowling alleys, a rifle range, a built-in vacuum system, a plethora of bronze doors, two secret, multi-floor passageways, a never-completed swimming pool now filled with gravestones, and 30 bathrooms (one of the showers contained six different showerheads for a full-body spray).Casa Loma serves as both an ostentatious landmark and a reminder to manage our money wisely.',\n",

These towering human-made stalactites are known as the Ice Castles.The Ice Castles project originated in Utah. It was started by Brent Christensen, who built an ice cave in his front yard to entertain his six kids. The structure was a hit, and has grown from a simple structure into a large-scale operation.Each year, the creators go to wintry locations including New Hampshire, Colorado, and Wisconsin to start growing the castles. A series of drip pipes start the process of trickling out their icicles—the “seeds” of the castles. These icicles then form the basis of the structures, which are made entirely out of ice and snow.Around 12,000 new icicles are formed and added every day. Team of artisans sculpt and coax the ice and snow into a system of tunnels and caves. By the time it’s done, a single ice castle weighs more than 20 million pounds.Inside the castles, visitors will find ice-carved tunnels, fountains, and slides. At night, the castles glow in pastel hues thanks to LED lights inside the frozen walls.Depending on the weather, the castle typically opens in January and stays up through March, when the icicles start to melt and all the pipes are packed up.',\n",

However, Pembroke Castle has a feature that makes it stand apart from the others: Lying underneath it is Wogan Cavern, an enormous natural cave.People can access the cave from a huge spiral staircase within the castle. Fifty-five steps lead down into the large subterranean limestone room, which was created by the natural process of water erosion.Wogan Cavern is at river level, and the castle owners blocked the cave entrance with a massive stone wall that contained a large door. It’s been proposed that the cave was used for directly loading and unloading ships on the river. It was also fortified with arrow slits.The cavern was used even before the medieval modifications that placed a castle atop it. It’s believed to have even been visited by the Romans.Apart from its magnificent cavern, the castle is also notable as the birthplace of Henry VII, first of the Tudor monarchs. It’s now the largest privately-owned castle in all of Wales.In the U.K., the only castle that is somewhat similar is Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, which is built directly over Peak Cavern.

Set on just under nine acres, the gardens were designed in the style of the Edo Period, the period of Japanese History from 1603-1868, when shoguns ruled Japan (also known as the Tokugawa shogunate).Professor Makoto Nakamura of Kyoto University designed the gardens so that, which each turn down one of the many paths, the view changes and it appears one has entered another garden entirely. As such, the gardens are themed – the garden of the lord’s residence, complete with requisite bridges, waterfall and koi pond, a tea garden, where a formal tea ceremony can be enjoyed for an additional fee, a pine tree garden, a bamboo garden, a flower garden, etc.While the gardens are beautiful in any season, if you can arrange your schedule with a bit of spontaneity, go to Japan during cherry blossom season (any time from March to May, depending).

Appropriate to its romantic setting, it was later reserved as a pre-Rafaelite artists’ retreat by the painters William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones.WWII ushered in a less-romantic purpose for the tower; with views stretching to Wales to the West and Buckinghamshire to the East, Broadway Tower became the perfect choice for the Royal Observers Corps to track enemy planes. In 1943, thick fog almost saw the end of the tower as an Allied bomber crashed into Beacon Hill a mere 200m from Broadway Tower.As 19th-Century progressed into the Cold War, an underground nuclear bunker and observation post was built next to the tower to monitor nuclear fallout in the event of a nuclear attack. Manned continuously from 1961 and designated as a master post, the bunker was one of the last constructed and, although decommissioned in 1991, the bunker is now one of the few remaining fully equipped facilities in England.Today the tower stands as a lovely example of the 18th and 19th century mania for follies, artificial ruins and romantic garden structures. The tower is now popular with local hikers, and houses exhibits related to the tower’s history including a William Morris room.

Over time, the story began to include accusations of sexual attacks and turned Elizabeth into a aging beauty obsessed by the idea of eternal youth found in the blood of virgins. Now perhaps irretrievably mired in myth and speculation, it may be impossible to completely separate fact from fiction.This much we know: Elizabeth was real, and died here. She was part of the powerful Hungarian Bathory family, and something went very wrong here in the early 1600s. She was married in 1575, as part of an arranged marriage at the age of 14 and received the Cachtice castle property, along with the surrounding feifdom of 17 villages as a wedding gift from her husband. The castle itself dates to at least 1276, when it was mentioned as a border protection fortress. In the early years, they seemed to be more or less a normal aristocratic family - he fought in battles far from home, she hung around the various family properties and eventually bore three children. Although there were a few strange accusations in the early 1600s, things did not get really weird until after her husband’s death in 1604, when she permanently moved to the castle property.Allegedly the routine (yet brutal) punishments of servants escalated into torture and death for minor infractions. A taste for violence led Elizabeth to send her loyal staff into the surrounding villages and countryside to lure young women to the castle, where they often met with grisly ends. When the locals started to wise up and refuse to let their daughters and sisters go to work at the castle, Elizabeth hit on a genius idea: in 1609 she opened a school for lady’s etiquette, then known as a Gynaecaeum. Young women from far-flung noble families began to arrive to receive instruction in the womanly arts from the aging widow. But it was this decision to become involved with noble families that was her downfall, as young ladies went missing, their angry fathers and brothers began to notice strange goings-on at the Castle Cachtice.In 1610, her castle was visited by local authorities, who reportedly discovered injured and dead young women on the property. Her three loyal collaborators were immediately seized and imprisoned. After what has been described as a show trial, the two female collaborators were executed in 1611, their fingertips pulled off with pincers before they were thrown alive into a fiery pit, which shows that the standards of the times were not so far off from Elizabeth’s own predilections. The male servant was beheaded and then thrown into a pit.There is speculation that the force of the trial may have been amplified for political reasons, with opportunists taking advantage of the opening to seize property and wealth from the Bathory clan, particularly since Elizabeth stood alone as a widow. The records also seem to indicate that Elizabeth was not specifically named herself as the perpetrator of the crimes, instead her household was implicated, perhaps out of deference to her status, and the possible embarrassment it would cause to other members of the nobility who had consorted with her.Elizabeth was placed under house arrest, walled in a tower of the castle, while the trial of her servants commenced. She remained there in isolation for four years, fed through a slot in the wall, until she was found dead in 1614. She was originally buried in the local cemetery, but due to local distaste, she was moved to her family home in Ecsed, Hungary.In the following centuries her story was alternately forgotten, and then sensationalized. Speculation has turned her into a lesbian vampire tyrant who sought eternal youth through the blood of virgins, but the truth seems to be gory enough without the supernatural trappings.The castle was abandoned in 1708, and is now in ruins.

Wilbraham could bring guests for outings at his fantastical little piece of fake history.While it looks like the remains of a much larger castle, the folly was built to seem like ruins, and only has the one main tower, and the free-standing arch at its side. Even if it’s not a piece of medieval history, the castle has been marked as a protected historical site (it is over 250 years old), so it won’t be crumbling any more than it already LOOKS like it has.Mow Cop Castle, a popular local landmark, used to be open to the public, but after someone committed suicide at the site, a fence was erected to keep people out.

       "  'Atop a small hilly path in Danbury, Connecticut lies a crumbling castle. The New York photographer E. Starr Sanford had it built between 1896 and 1899 as his summer retreat. The castle had 16 rooms including nine bedrooms, a library, and a billiard room. The exterior was made from local stone, however, the wood—some of which still remains in the veranda—was imported from Italy.Sanford and his family lived there for five years before selling it in 1902 to a gentleman named Victor Buck. In 1918, Buck sold it to Charles Darling Parks, who bought it for his daughter Irene. Charles renamed the castle “Hearthstone,” reportedly after the eight stone fireplaces throughout the castle. Hearthstone remained in the Parks family for 70 years.In 1985, the city of Danbury purchased Hearthstone Castle and Tarrywile Mansion, which lies across the street in Tarrywile Park. In 2008, several teenagers were arrested for vandalizing what remained of the castle interior. (They were caught after posting a video of their romp on YouTube.) In 2016, the city approved a plan to convert the long-abandoned castle into a walled garden.',\n",

And some, like the Ventura family, honor it with a magnificent roadside castle.Since 1957 the Mars Cheese Castle has proudly dispensed a wide selection of cheese and related products to travelers looking to take home a memento of their journey through Wisconsin. Originally opened as a gas station in 1947 (which burned to the ground 10 years later), Mars Cheese Castle eventually grew to become the largest, oldest, showiest purveyor at the junction of 1-94 and Wisconsin Highway 142, a spot once dubbed “Wisconsin’s most visible cheese interchange” by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The store was named not after the planet but after the original owner, Mario Ventura Sr., though this detail hasn’t stopped the venue from incorporating a small touch of outer space into its castle motif (see logo).In 2011, plans to widen I-94 forced Mars Cheese Castle to abandon the storefront it had used for over 50 years. Rather than mourn the loss of their beloved fortress, the proprietors used the opportunity to update the store’s image. Whereas the turrets on the former building’s facade merely suggested a castle, the new, larger store, outfitted with a drawbridge and a watchtower, is an abode truly fit for a king (of cheese). In exchange for its willingness to relocate, the state agreed to allow Mars Cheese Castle to keep its iconic sign, which, at 80 feet tall, violates current height restrictions for signs along the interstate.Though cheese is, of course, the main attraction, Mars Cheese Castle also sells a variety of meats, bakery items, and cheese-themed knick-knacks, including the state’s most essential souvenir, the famed Wisconsin cheese-head hat.',\n",

       "  'The Englewood Post Office was built over a portion of the site once occupied by the famous “H.H. Holmes Murder Castle.” The story as it is generally told, and made famous in Eric Larson’s bookDevil in the White City, is that during the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition, Holmes built an intricate hotel on this spot for visitors to the world’s fair, killing and robbing many of them. The house was designed as a death trap, with gas lines he could control to asphyxiate people in their sleep (or not) and chutes he would use to dump his victims unseen into the basement, where he would dissect them, sometimes selling their bodies to medical schools, sometimes just disposing of the evidence.However according to Adam Selzer, a Holmes expert, the true story is a bit less salacious than that. When Holmes, a swindler, was arrested for insurance fraud in 1894, people remembered that he had a three-story building on 63rd Street that was known to be full of hidden rooms and secret passages. Then they realized that a handful of his employees had disappeared, and wondered if those passages could be for more than just hiding stolen furniture. Some of the missing people were found alive and well, but roughly half a dozen never were. He eventually confessed to 27murders, though several of the people he confessed to killing were still alive at the time. Authorities thought the figure was closer to a dozen; pulp writers in the 20th century started crediting him with hundreds more. Most of the “castle” would have been in the space now occupied by the grassy knoll just east of the post office.Whatever the truth of the Holmes case, the post office that sits on the site of the castle today is unremarkable in every way. If you need to visit the post office for more mundane reasons itprovides counter, money order, and P.O. Box services, but does not process passport applications or renewals.

       "  'Underneath the modern city of Nottingham is a large and ancient labyrinthine underworld. Over 800 caves, tunnels, and passages cut into the sandstone rock lurk beneath the city, and more are discovered every year.The oldest recorded name for Nottingham is “Tigguo Cobauc,” which, in the pre-Roman ancient British language is thought to mean “Place of Caves.” The name is still appropriate today, as there are more caves underneath the city than any other in Britain. Nottingham sits on a ridge of soft sandstone hills, which in places have been cut into low cliff faces by the action of the River Leen and River Trent. The exposed soft crumbly rock is incredibly easy to cut and burrow into.The caves were dug for many reasons: as workplaces, such as the medieval tannery that exists underneath a shopping mall; as homes, such as those at Sneinton hermitage; as secret passages and tunnels, such as those at Castle Rock; as storerooms, brewhouses, and public houses; as prisons and dungeons; and in more recent history, as air raid shelters during the Nottingham Blitz. Scattered across the city are small doors and gates, complete with rusty padlocks that cover access points into the greatly interconnected labyrinth.The Nottingham Caves Survey, a project by researchers at Nottingham University to digitally map the caves, has seen many local homeowners come forward to reveal that they too have caves leading off into the subterranean maze from their basements or tucked away in the corner of their garden. Some have been surprised to learn that their particular cave was previously unknown. As recently as January 2017, a group of students living on one of the main roads into the city, Mansfield Road, discovered a series of steps leading down from their cellar into a previously unknown void under the city streets.One of the most well-known and well-connected cave systems is the Broadmarsh Caves, which is open to visitors under the name “City of Caves.” This visitor attraction can be accessed from a dilapidated shopping mall, the Broadmarsh Centre, which is scheduled for demolition and redevelopment. In it, underneath the 1970s brutalist edifice, visitors can take a guided tour around the medieval tannery cut out of the sandstone, the remains of a medieval slum, and one of the city’s sandstone air-raid shelters.Another system called Mortimer’s Hole is also open to the public, accessed from Brewhouse Yard. This cave is named after Sir Roger Mortimer, the lover of Queen Isabella of England in 1330. The enraged king is said to have entered the grounds of Nottingham Castle by stealth through this secret tunnel, from the base of the Castle Rock cliff, and seized poor Mortimer as he lay in bed with the queen. He was taken from Nottingham to London to be hung, drawn, and quartered. (Tales of his ghost still haunting the hole, which bears his name, remain unverified.)Other great places to visit the caves include the Trip to Jerusalem public house, reputed to be England’s oldest pub, Victorian Music Hall Malt Cross, the Lost Caves cocktail bar, and the Hand and Heart, all of which have cave rooms for drinking and eating in, and the Bell Inn. If you inquire in advance, the Bell can arrange tours of its caves underneath the Old Market Square, including one that contains a well once used by local monks for brewing ale. Live action puzzle fans are accommodated in one of the city’s latest labyrinths to be made publicly accessible; the “Cave Escape” escape rooms can be found in gloomy subterranean chambers and tunnels beneath Mansfield Road.',\n",

A secret password opens a hidden entry to the main building.Performances include highly produced shows where a very talented magician turns bunnies into doves and doves into mice. Lounge entertainment is provided by Irma, the “invisible ghost” playing any song requested of her on the Castle’s grand piano.The labyrinthine mansion was originally one of Hollywood’s great chateau-inspired manors, built in 1909. By the 1950s, the once-grand building had passed through many hands and fallen into disrepair. In 1955 magicianWilliam Larsen formed the Academy of Magical Arts, and in 1961 William’s son Bill purchased the building and began converting it into a magic-themed clubhouse, which opened two years later as the Magic Castle.Today the Academy boasts nearly 5000 members, a mix of auditioned magicians and associate members . The building has been expanded and renovated many times over the years creating a decade-spanning pastiche of antiques and vintage collectables colliding with odd, theme-park-style decor in other areas. This peculiar combination and comfortably worn edges give the building a certain charm.Downstairs in a hallway near the Hat and Hare pub, concept art and objects from Disney’s Haunted Mansion line the wall, including a proof-of-concept diorama of the haunted ballroom scene, which uses a famous illusionist’s trick known as the Pepper’s Ghost illusion.The castle serves not only as a social gathering place for magicians and magic enthusiasts, but also as an important repository of knowledge on illusions and the history of magic. There is a small museum in a downstairs theater space, dozens – if not hundreds – of historic posters, art and ephemera related to magic and famous magicians, as well as portraits honoring some of the best known. Hidden away downstairs is a research library open to magician members only, dedicated to books on magic.Over the years, many stories have been told about the building’s alleged resident and visiting specters, including that of former magician-in-residence Dai Vernon. His ashes were once kept on a high shelf outside the Parlour of Prestidigitation, where he watched shows from the front row every night until his death in 1992.The Castle was badly damaged in a fire that broke out in October 2011 in the attic space of the building. It reopened after repairs in February 2012. Ironically, the Castle’s Halloween theme that year was “Inferno” where, with the use of lighting and projectors, the Castle was made to look like it was engulfed in flames.

The room is adorned by intricately carved oak paneling and filled with stained glass windows. In the center of the house, the great hall branches off into the drawing room, the blue and white ballroom, the library and other rooms.On the grounds of the castle, visitors will find an 18th-century stable block constructed of dark-colored stones as well as a huge kitchen garden.As the home is maintained and operated by the Gerald Arthur Rolph Foundation for Historic Preservation and Education, it remains in incredible condition.

The house was built in the traditional baronial style with pointed towers and asymmetrical living areas to give the royalty the opulent house they felt they deserved.The royals lived in the house until 1925 when the home was turned into a hotel complete with a golf course.However, once the Second World War began, the estate was taken over for the war effort and turned into a hospital. During this time, the stately house of healing saw a number those wounded in the war, most famously attending to Rudolph Hess, Hitler’s right-hand man, after he flew to Scotland in 1941. After the war ended the building was briefly used as a school, but was eventually partially demolished and left to nature.Today, the golf course remains and is still in use, but the castle grounds themselves are covered in creeping plants that are slowly covering all of the still-standing walls.

However, the attraction proved such a hit with locals and visitors alike that a more permanent structure was builtin 1904.The castle itself is divided into four sections, showcasing Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, and Romanesque architecture. Within each section, the castle is further divided, in total comprising twenty-one smaller buildings linked together, each having been designed as a replica of other significantstructuresto be found throughout Hungary and Romania. Perhaps the most striking section of the castle is the Gothicwing, modeled on Corvin Castle in Romania, which served as the historical home of János Hunyadi, the Hungarian noble from whom Vajdahunyad Castle derives its name.Located on an artificial island in the heart of Budapest within spitting distance of Hungary’s national monument, Vajdahunyad Castle nonetheless presents an odd contrast to its stately surroundings. The clash of colors, patterns, engravings, and building materials give the structure an almost funhouse-like appearance, and eerie statues of Béla Lugosi and the anonymous author of theGesta Hungarorum,“the deeds of the Hungarians,” on the castle grounds add to the site’s dreamy ambiance.The castle also houses the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture.',\n",

Boldt. Mirroring 16th century European aesthetics, the palatial estate was built on Heart Island as a devotional work for Boldt’s wife, Louise. In addition to the large mansion they built a medieval-styled power house, and the tall “Alster Tower,” which was to be used for entertaining guests once the mansion was finished. Boldt also had a number of heart-shaped flourishes worked into the design of the grounds. Most of the construction on the architectural love letter was complete when tragedy struck the Boldts.In 1904, while the family was still living in the Alster Tower, Louise passed away and George was devastated. Boldt immediately ordered work on the mansion to cease, and he took his family away from the island, vowing never to return. After work on the home stopped, the grounds sat empty for over 70 years before the it was decided that the rotting estate might turn a profit if it was revitalized.By 1977 the mansion was finished by the new owners of the land and now the enchanting castle and its island gardens are used as an event space.

To this end, many of the doorways are painted like giant, misshapen mouths and the halls of the gallery are filled with odd works by the artist. The corridors are filled with strange attractions such as a car full of plants and snails that rains inside (the secret is a semi-hidden coin slot that makes the water work), and a room with furniture designed to look like Mae West’s face when viewed at the right angle. Of course the museum is also home to many of Dalí’s most famous paintings.The exterior of the building is easily as impressive as the interior with the strange site of massive eggs crowning the main outer wall and a large geodesic dome rising up beyond those. The wall itself is dotted with loaves of bread that look like irregular flagstones. On another side of the building, fantastical creatures preside over the buildings arches. a motif that is continued in the interior courtyard as well.Very few artists live to see the sort of adoration that Dalí’s work received, and even fewer have the foresight to think about how it will be viewed by future generations, but the Dalí Theatre and Museum all but ensures that that artist’s iconoclastic works will have a home well into the future.

In the 1980s he helped found the Czech art group Tvrdohlaví (The Stubborn). He built Podobenství s Lebkou, aka “Parable with Skull” in 1993, a bronze sculpture of a beggar weighed down by a large skull resides on a thick slab of aging wood.The sculpture used to be found at the eastern end of the Golden Lane by Prague Castle’s Daliborka Tower, where Dalibor of Kozojedy, known as the Robin Hood of Czechia, was said to have played the violin while waiting out his days.Parable with Skull is based on one of Kafka’s characters—the “beggar, who, with the death rattle already in his throat, insists on dying on the doorstep” from The Bucket Rider. The sculpture tends to intrigue and even confuse those who visit the castle without prior knowledge of Róna’s surrealist works. There’s also a surprise at the rear end of the statue: the beggar’s dangling bronze testicles are displayed quite prominently, often shocking admirers of the piece.Prague is a city known for its strange public sculptures, and Róna’s are among the strangest, but Parable with Skull isn’t a public work.

The main two-story manor, which locals referred to as “the Castle,” was built by slave laborers using a material called “tabby,” a mixture of crushed and sifted oyster shells, lime, water, and sand.In 1856, Seminoles attacked the Castle, which Dr. Braden successfully defended. The following year Hector passed away and the plantation fell on hard times after corn borers destroyed acres of sugar cane. Eventually, Dr. Braden found himself deeply in debt. The Castle went into foreclosure and Dr. Braden returned to the panhandle.The Castle, meanwhile, changed hands and became a local landmark for early settlers and treasure seekers who came to the area hoping to find a cache left by Spanish explorers. After a fire destroyed the structure in 1903, the remains were abandoned and left for nature to reclaim.Then the “tin can tourists” started arriving Florida around 1919. Ford’s Model T had made it possible for Northerners to drive down for the winter (making them, arguably, Florida’s first “snowbirds”) and the visitors quickly discovered the need for a more permanent site of their own after tensions arose with the locals. The “Camping Tourists of America,” incorporated in 1924, put up tents, and then cottages, around the skeletal remains of Braden Castle.The first boat dock went up in 1927 and by the early 1930s most of the structures were in place, with a seasonal population of roughly 1,000 people from 26 different states. Victory gardens were planted in the 1940s, and the town of Manatee was absorbed into Bradenton in the 1950s. The park that built up around the Castle, named Braden Castle Park, was recognized as a unique historical district in 1985, and the once-seasonal visitors to the area were joined by a new wave of retirees.Today, the remnants of Dr. Braden’s once stately manor can still be found in the center of Braden Castle Park, fenced off to the public but clearly visible.

The resulting castle is easily one of the most stunning in all of Europe.The construction took 10 years, but by the end of it, the Romanian royals had a summer palace equipped with everything from a movie theater to a concert hall. The ornate 160-room palace was built in aNeo-Renaissance style and each room had its own identity and theme.After its inauguration in 1883, the king and his family began spending their summers in the fairytale castle, which also served as the venue for important meetings during the early months of World War I.The first couple to live there, King Carol I and his wife Queen Elizabeth of Romania were known to be very different in temperament and interests. The king was an accomplished soldier who greatly expanded and improved the Romanian military, and the queen was more artistic, with a great fondness for music, art, and literature, and even published poetry under the pen name Carmen Sylva. Peleș, too, was a reflection of these two different personalities.On one hand, there was an extensive 4,000-piece collection of weaponry from Europe and Asia on display in the Weapons Room. On the other, there was a beautifully appointed movie theater, whose walls and ceilings were decorated with frescoes by Austrian artists Gustav Klimt andFranz von Matsch. The first movie projection in Romania is reported to have taken place in this room. Other art forms were far from neglected.

       "  'The plain facade of this townhouse betrays nothing of the atrocities that may have takenplace here when it was the residence of one CountessElizabeth Báthory.Elizabeth Báthory is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most prolific female murderer ever, but she might even be the most prolific murderer of all the Western World. She allegedly tortured and killed more than 600 virgin women in order to drink and bathe in their blood, believing it would preserve her youth and beauty.Some historians believe that these accusations were trumped up as an intrigue to bring down a powerful woman, but the number of testimonies against her as well as Báthory’s own confessions make for a convincing case.At the turn of the 17th century, the “Blood Countess” intermittently lived in her husband’s Hungarian House at 12 Augustinerstrasse, right in the heart of Vienna. The rest of her time was spent at Cachtice Castle, where she eventually moved full-time as she drew more and more suspicion.The city’s nearby markets served as a hunting ground for Bathory’s servant Ficzkó,who was instrumental in providing a steady stream of young Viennese maids for the countess. With the promise of food, shelter, comfort, and security, the young women would leave their families to serve the mysterious noblewomen. Ficzkó and other servants would return year after year, luring in more and more young ladies (all of them beautiful), but those who left would never be seen again.Some were taken to Cachtice Castle, though in the beginning some were employedat the Hungarian House. Though no townsperson dared to question the countess,there were frequently strange sounds emanating from the house at nighttime. Apparently the nocturnal disturbances onceeven prompted the monks from the Augustinian monastery across the street to pelt the house with earthenware, demanding silence.It apparently began as simple domestic abuse, flogging them and leaving them naked in the snow—atrocious, to be sure, but not uncommon in these pre-OSHA days. But the abuse the young women suffered at the hands of the countess and her accomplices grew more and more diabolic. Reports included everything from pulling their fingers off to biting the flesh from their faces, and then, of course, draining their blood so that she could bathe in it.All of this was eventually discovered at her castle, where she was put on an early form of house arrest—simply walled in and never allowed to venture out. You can visit the ruins, but for some Elizabeth Báthory deep cuts, pay a visit to her townhouse in Vienna, the place it all began.',\n",

Accounts of his journey to North America vary, but he eventually settled in South Hero after marrying a local. He would work various jobs there for the rest of his life, carving out his legacy by adding these castles to the properties he gardened.After the first few castles showed up, demand grew quickly. Each was made modestly from fieldstone, yet each is unique—some even have electrical wiring and running water in the moat! Others have drawbridges, glass windows, flags, and long spiral staircases. Local lore has it that the castles were so beloved by locals that they even became bartering chips.Barber tragically died by suicide in 1966, but a selection of his castles continues to beautify South Hero to this day.

So why was this random fortress built? According to local legend, it was meant to trap demons.Supposedly, a gate to hell opened on the craggy Czech mountain. The castle was constructed around the portal, and a chapel was plopped directly atop the hole to keep evil monsters from spilling out of the underworld and slipping into the human realm.Folklore says the supposed gate to hell was so deep no one could see the bottom of it, and those who did attempt to enter the dark orifice encountered demonic human-animal hybrids. People claim cars won’t start near the castle and strange, bleeding beasts still roam the area after dark.In reality, the castle was built as an administrative center to oversee the management of royal estates. But it still has some real-life demons in its past. Nazis occupied the fortress during World War II, and multiple myths abound about their supposed occult involvements there.It’s possible to tour the mysterious castle and scope out any hauntings for yourself.

It’s no wonder; the whimsical otherworldly landscape looks just like the kind of place you’d expect to find mythical creatures. The Isle of Skye is, after all, rich with faerie lore.

The castle was designed in 1928 by the Austrian architect and set designer Joseph Urban. It was commissioned by F.H. Bennett, who was the owner of F.H. Bennett Biscuit Company in New York City. Bennett bought the New Jersey property in 1921 to expand his operations and open the Wheatsworth Mills.Bennett was inspired to create his version of a fairytale castle on the property after seeing Urban’s set design work at a performance of “Hansel and Gretel” at the Metropolitan Opera. In addition to this, Bennett drew a lot of his inspiration for the castle from his fond childhood memories of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales.The castle opened in 1930 and quickly became a popular tourist destination. Unfortunately, by the early 1980s, the castle began its decline from a beloved amusement park to a decrepit castle. Throughout the years, the castle and its surrounding property have gone through many transformations,including being a nightclub and at another point a haunted house.In 2004, New Jersey resident Frank Hinger purchased the property and began to restore the castle with assistance from grants, fundraisers, and loyal fans of the castle. Despite his noble efforts, the property became too expensive for him to fully revitalize. A real estate developer bought the property, including the castle and the former Wheatsworth Mills factory. The developer made promises to continue with the restoration efforts, but so far nothing has been done. The castle is decaying and falling into a severe state of disrepair.

The year marks the ascent of Queen Victoria to the British throne, and her reign (until 1901) was noted by several cultural traits, among which was an appreciation of pets and companion animals.The same appreciation for animals that led to the story ofGreyfriars Bobbycould also have led to the establishment of this cemetery, especially since burial plots in castles were often considered exclusive to military personnel and nobles.The small graveyard is home to about 20 headstones. Many of the engravings have worn away over time, but theoldest visible inscription is from 1881, a dedication to Jess, band pet of the Black Watch 42nd Royal Highlanders. The youngest headstone commemorates Winkle, who died in 1980 and was the “dear and faithful friend of Lady Gow and the Governor.”The Scottish poet Robert Burns once commemorated the dog cemetery of Edinburgh Castle in verse: “Berkin dugs here lie at rest / The yappin worst, obedient best / Sodgers pets and mascots tae / Still the guard the castle to this day.” However, this has proven to be erroneous. The words actually were penned byAli Strachan, who worked for Historic Environment Scotland and were mistakenly attributed to the national bard when she was compiling poems for a Burns Night Supper.The site of the cemetery may have once been a medieval tower, but it now acts as the final resting place for honored canine companions of the regimental officers.

       "  'At the beginning of the 17th century, Wewelsburg Castle was built on behalf of the Prince Bishops of Paderborn. The unusual triangular-shaped castle stood high on a rock overlooking the Alme Valley. Over the next few centuries, the castle would change hands several times. Then in 1933, Heinrich Himmler signed a 100-year lease for Wewelsburg.At that point in time, the interior of the structure was badly decaying, but Himmler saw potential in the triangle-shaped hilltop castle for use as a training facility for the Schutzstaffel (SS), which he commanded. The Nazi Party believed in the superiority of the so-called Aryan race (or “German blood”). Many prominent Nazi leaders harkened back to mythology and legend to influence their plans for world domination. Himmler himself was fascinated with prophecy and magical power, and desperately wanted to set up a facility to teach these values to SS soldiers. He began working to turn Wewelsburg into a non-military training facility focused on the occult, pagan rituals.Himmler viewed Wewelsburg as the Grail Castle, and believed that when the Nazis were the rulers of the entire world, artifacts from the castle would radiate magical power. Much work was put into acquiring such artifacts as the Spear of Destiny, which Hitler himself had claimed showed him his future.Along with artifacts from around the world that the SS were working to acquire, Wewelsburg became the center of a number of pagan rituals led by Himmler. Although the exact nature of the rituals are unknown, it is clear that baptism-like rituals took place, and a former cistern in the castle was turned into a crypt also used for ritual. After the Allies took control of the castle, a round table with 12 chairs was also discovered, a reference to King Arthur and his knights.During the 12 years that the SS had control of Wewelsburg, the castle was far from finished and the grand plans Himmler had in mind were not completed. Himmler had hoped to design a castle with a circular fortification around the hill, and a gigantic moat. To create the moat, the SS had ordered the evacuation of the surrounding town, and were intending on flooding the entire valley around Wewelsburg.Due to the massive amount of work, Himmler also set up his own private concentration camp, formed mostly of criminals, prisoners of war and Roma people to use as slave labor in restoring the castle. The camp, called Niederhagen, held some 4,000 people, and approximately half of them died as a result of inhumane living conditions and abuse by the SS. As the Nazis were losing the war, Himmler ordered the castle demolished and a fire was set inside. Although most of the interior was destroyed, the exterior walls were preserved.Today, Wewelsburg has been turned into a museum.One of its departments showcases the history of the region and the castle itself, while the other documents theNazi’s use of the castle during World War II.',\n",

When he fell in love a third time, it was with Rosa Pelham, daughter of a Congressman from Alabama and 29 years his junior.The couple married, and Samuel built his new bridea castle.The site of the castle would be a ridge overlooking the popular spa town of Berkeley Springs, West Virginia. Berkeley Springs had long been a popular resort destination, particularly among the elite from not-too-distant Washington, D.C. looking to escape the miserable summer weather. Warm mineral springs and cool, clear mountain air attracted the likes of George Washington, James Madison, Martin Van Buren, and Henry Clay. Being members of the Washington high society that summered in the little destination town, Berkeley Springs was in fact where Rosa and Samuel first met.They were married in 1883, and the first stone of their castle was laid in 1885. It would be but one of the several dozen “cottages” built by the wealthy summer patrons of Berkeley Springs, but theirs would stand out thanks to its extravagant appearance inspired by Norman castle architecture.

Once completed, she took up residence year-round in her castle, where she entertained regularly and lavishly. She would sometimes rent railroad cars to bring her guests from D.C. to her sumptuously appointed parties, featuring opulent spreads and bands that kept revelers dancing through the night.Alas, the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and by the turn of the century Rosa Pelham Suit found that the money had run out. She started renting out the castle to generate some income, and in 1902 sold considerable land holdings (known as “Suitland”) amassed by her late husband in Maryland, but it was to no avail. The castle was sold at public auction in 1913, and Rosa retired to a small house (described in some sources as a “shack”) and raised chickens, later moving to Idaho with her son Samuel.The Berkeley Springs Castle was home to a boys’ summer camp from 1938 to 1954, and was operated as a museum open to the public from 1954 to 1999.

The fort was originally constructed as a symbol of the power of the Count of Flanders, it was Philip, who had fought in the Crusades and seen a number of grand castles in his travels, who insisted that the walls and towers of the castle be built to such a height that their very presence would let everyone know just how much money and influence their position held.Gravensteen is often called the Castle of the Counts for this reason.Eventually, the counts abandoned their seat in the 14th century and the castle became simply a prison and courthouse. It featured multiple courthouses and subterranean dungeons in which criminals and accused simply awaiting trial were kept in unlivable conditions and frequently tortured.While the barbaric activities were abandoned as the area became more civilized in the ensuing centuries, the site never lost the taint of the horrors that were once perpetrated within its walls. By the end of the 1800s, the structure had become unsound and its reputation was doing nothing for it in the court of public opinion, thus Gravensteen was nearly razed.Luckily a preservation group realized the architectural and (however horrible) historical importance and managed to save the castle. Today, the site has been greatly restored still retaining a decorative moat on three sides, and is open to the public, even featuring a torture museum, possibly as some sort of mea culpa.Despite its grim past, Gravensteen is still one of the most stunning historic castles remaining in the world.

Scenes from, Framed (1975), Ernest Goes to Jail (1990), and The Last Castle with Robert Redford (2001) were also all filmed at the prison.Update as of March 2020: A tornado toppled large portions of the old prison, its future is unclear.',\n",

       "  'Having been featured in photos, ads, and films, the island fortesss known asEilean Donanhas spent centuries solidifying its position as the most iconic image of Scotland for natives and foreigners alike.Built on an island a mile away from the Village of Dornie, the land was first occupied in 634 AD, home to the monastic cell of Bishop Donan. During the 13th-century Alexander II built the first incarnation of Eilean Donan to defend the surrounding mountains of Kintail and the Isle of Skye against the Viking hordes. This original castle is said to have an immense curtained wall connecting seven towers and spanning the entire island. Come 1719, a lesser-known Jacobite uprising partially destroyed the structure, and for the following 200 years, it lay in near ruins. Finally, in1911, Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap arrived. He bought the island and restored the castle, reopening it in 1932.Jutting artfully from its island perch at the intersection of three lochs, the castle has been featured in a number of ad campaigns, television, and films, such as;The New Avengers(1976),Highlander(1986), and Entrapment (1999). As of 2021, the Internet Movie Database (IMBD lists 21 entries in which it was used as a location, beginning with “Bonnie Prince Charlie” starring David Niven in 1948. Today, what is deemed the fourth incarnation of the castle (the history of the second and third structures remains unknown) is still owned by the MacRae family, who run a tourist center and restaurant for those who care to venture into the Feudal folds of Scotland’s history.',\n",

He had been offered a job as a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, and as he made his way across the country by foot, he captivated the nation with weekly letters of his escapades and detailed descriptions of the countryside he passed through.Upon his arrival, he was named first city editor. A do-it-yourself kind of guy, when Lummis was faced with the decision of where he would hang his hat in his new city, he decided he’d like to live in a castle. Los Angeles did not have an abundance of castles for sale, so Lummis built one by hand out of stones he pulled out of the river.The 4,000-square-foot home took 13 years to build.By taking a much shorter walk than Lummis did, you can enjoy a free tour of his castle house and gardens, now a historical landmark displaying artifacts and tales of the adventures of this little-known eccentric. The house is credited with being one of the first to spark the Arts & Crafts aesthetic that would soon monopolize architecture styles. Word on the street is that by asking for the “dirty tour,” you become privy to a much more interesting version of Lummis and his shenanigans.',\n",

Sadly, the outer walls have not survived the ages as well as the castle.Fiddaun Castle was built around 1574 and is remarkably preserved—the only things missing from it are the outer walls and the attic, or top story. It is best known for its incredibly intact inner walls, or bawn. They still stand around the tower house with climbable steps and walkable defenses. Though the castle has been empty for hundreds of years, it is also intact and you can explore every floor, corner, and even the rooftop if you can traverse the incredibly narrow and slippery spiral staircase. This makes it an unusual and slightly dangerous treat that you can explore at will.Fiddaun is on private land and maintained by the Department of Public Works. To get there, you must pick up the key from the landowners (who may or may not chaperone or guide you) and hike through acres of fields before the castle even comes into view. It is a hidden gem tucked into the countryside and is not visible from the road. It is well worth the trek however, and it provides a rare glimpse into the castle living of the past.The castle and the walk to it are not easily accessible. A sturdy pair of shoes is a necessity and a bottle of water is recommended. There are no facilities on site unless you count the centuries old garderobe, or medieval toilet, which is likely still intact as well.',\n",

       "  'Edinburgh Castle is a hotbed of tourist activity. More than a million people mill about its esplanade each year while they push through the throngs of visitors edging toward the castle gates. Many are unaware they’re walking atop the same ground that once saw the terrible death of hundreds of accused witches. Being accused of witchcraft the guilty parties were denied a proper burial and thus their remains were left where they perished.The Witches’ Well, a cast iron fountain and plaque, honors the Scottish people who were burned at the stake between the 15thand 18thcenturies. It’s an easy site to miss for people only focusing on the castle that looms ahead. During the 16thcentury, more women were murdered at this site than anywhere else in Scotland. Each victim was denied a proper trial.Scotland’s King James VI believed witchcraft was a form of Satanism and that anyone who possessed those abilities was tainted by the devil. As a result, in the 17th and 18th centuries, more than 4,000 alleged witches (mostly female) were put to death.By the end of the 17th century, witches were routinely hanged instead of being burned. The last hanging took place in 1728.During the satanic panic of the time, anyone could be accused of using black magic. Those killed were often mere herbalists, the mentally ill, or those on the wrong end of someone else’s ill will. Suspected women were frequently bound by the hands and feet, then thrown into a lake to determine their innocence. Those who drowned were cleared, and those who had the audacity to survive were accused of witchcraft and sent to the stake.In 1894, Sir Patrick Geddes, a philanthropist known for his innovative thinking in urban planning and sociology, commissioned his friend John Duncan to design this drinking fountain for the west side of Castlehill Reservoir next to Ramsay Garden. Duncan was a famed artist who was influenced by Celtic myth and legend, which is evident in the sculpture.The small plaque, which features a bronze relief of witches’ heads entangled by a snake, uses dualism to highlight the balance between good and evil and to show that every story has two sides. The relief contains the image of a Foxglove plant, from the center of which is a coiled snake intertwined around the head of Aesculapius, the god of medicine, and his daughter Hygeia, the goddess of health.The Foxglove plant, though used medicinally, can also be poisonous depending on dosage, and the image of the serpent imbued with wisdom is also acknowledged as evil.A hole beneath the snake’s head once spouted water, though it’s dry now. The upper left corner contains Roman Numerals equivalent to 1479, and 1722 is depicted in the bottom right (the period of the most prevalent persecution of witches in Scotland.) The bottom left displays the year of the sculpture’s completion and the sculptor’s initials: 18 (JD) 94. Two bolts on the upper corners differ in design, and are Wiccan symbols of air and water.The trough is sculpted on three sides. The font displays flora with roots beneath the earth and branches above. The left panel depicts the Evil Eye with frowning eyes and a nose. The right side depicts a pair of hands holding a bowl, meant to represent healing hands.A plaque above the well was erected in 1912. ',\n",

       "  'The word paradise often conjures images of a luscious beach, blue-green waves, and hammocks stretched between palm trees. However, the Czechs might offer a different opinion on the subject.Czechia is a landlocked country that has a moderate Central European climate and remnants of a communist past that is all too recent. Despite these impediments to the classical paradise, the Czech forests surrounding Turnov offer a specifically Czech version of utopia.Bohemian Paradise, or Český ráj in Czech, is a protected area in the north of the country, covered in majestic forests, hilltop castles and volcanic pillars. Only a day-trip away from the capital, Prague, it has become a popular tourist destination.Among the sites in the area, the Hrubá Skála rock town, is the most famous. Just seven kilometers from Turnov, the rock town is punctuated with volcanic sandstone pillars shooting through the tree line. The bright white of the pillars strikingly contrasts the deep greens of the surrounding woodland. The jewel of Hrubá Skála is the chateau of the same name, situated magnificently on one of the rocks. Although Hrubá Skála is the most notable of rock outcroppings in Bohemian Paradise, the rest of the protected area is dotted with similar volcanic pillars and a hike around the area is a breathtaking endeavor. There are many lookouts in the area, but finding the ones with the best views on your own may be time-consuming. Taking a tour with a local guide might be an interesting option.Along with the stunning forest landscape cut by the Bohemian Jizera River, Trosky Castle in the heart of Bohemian Paradise cannot be missed. Trosky Castle is comprised of two 14th-century ruins well over one hundred feet above the ground. The two ruins rise prominently from atop a hill and volcanic plugs, sending them high into the sky above the flatlands around the area.Originally built by a Czech nobleman, the castle has survived multiple wars and attacks and miraculously can still be visited by tourists. While roaming the landscape around the castle, visitors should also inspect the caves near the base of the castle’s hills. The castle lies only fifteen kilometers from Turnov and should be included in any itinerary through Český ráj.Another great place in the region are the extremely picturesque sandstone pinnacles of the Prachov Rocks (Prachovské skály). They are situated close to the quaint small town of Jičín. Visiting them requires paying a small entrance fee, but if landscapes and nature are your thing, then you would not want to miss them.',\n",

But not all visitors know about its hidden gem.The grand, airy Victorian building is home to thousands of artifacts from around the globe and natural worldcollections. And following the opening of the adjoining modern building in 1998, visitors can also learn about Scotland’s long and colourful history, inventions through the ages, plus science, technology and design. The museum is home to both a T-Rex skeleton cast and Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal ever to be created from an adult cell. When you visit, don’t forget to takethe lift all the way to the 7th floor. You’ll exit onto the rooftop terrace, well worth checking out for its panoramic view. Sure, there are wonderful vantage points from plenty of places in Edinburgh, not least the city’s seven hills, but not many are slap bang in the middle of the Old Town. Unless you’re lucky enough to be staying in accommodation nearby, this is one of the best places to enjoy a view right in amongst Auld Reekie’s rooftops and to the busy streets below, and to admire the wide vistas across to the Edinburgh Castle, the New Town, the Braid Hills and the Firth of Forth. You even get an elevated peek into Greyfriars Kirkyard.The terrace was designed by sculptor Andy Goldsworthy in honor of Edinburgh-born James Hutton, known as the founder of modern geology, (https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hutton-memorial-garden). Sandstone blocks sit on the decked platform and plant life along the edge of the terrace represents different aspects of Scotland’s landscape, from coastal plants to grassland vegetation.The minimalist design helps put the focus on the dazzling views from all four sides of the terrace. It’s a great place to escape the crowds below during thetourist months and to get a different perspective on the city.

But this is Corvin Castle, which looks like something straight out of a fairytale, largely because restorers thought that it should.Built in the mid-15th century, the castle was the workof military leader John Hunyadi, who constructed the tall structure over the remains of a keep built by Charles I.Corvin Castle is split into three large areas: The Knight’s Hall, the Diet Hall, and the circular stairways. Each of these three parts is surrounded by both circular and rectangular towers that were used for both defense and as a prison.The elaborate architecture was designed in a rich gothic style that accentuates the already impressive structure. The castle was kept in regal condition during Hunyadi’s lifetime, but after he died, the castle fell into swift decline.It was not until the 17th century that there was more interest in restoring this medieval castle. As the restoration work began, the workers redesigned the castle to reflect what they considered a gothic castle should look like, which explains much of its currently fanciful look.A number of legends are associated with the castle. Though this is likely untrue, tourists are told that Vlad the Impaler spent some seven years in the dungeons of Corvin Castle, a stay which resulted in his eventual madness.',\n",

       "  'On a hill in the town of Valkenburg, in the southern province of Limburg, the ruins of a Dutch castle sit on top of a sprawling network of tunnels and passageways. Known as Kasteelruine Fluweelengrot, in English it translates roughly to the Castle Ruins and the Velvet Cave.The history of the castle at Valkenburg began centuries before it was reduced to ruins, back in 1115. The castle is unique for the Netherlands in that it sits on a hill, and although it was a strategic choice of location, the original fortification was destroyed soon after it was built. So it was rebuilt – and destroyed again. The current castle dates to the 14th century, and almost made it intact.It suffered its ruination in the late 16th and early 17th centuries during the Eighty Years War with Spain. By 1672 it was a shambles, attacked one last time at the outset of the Franco-Dutch War. In order to keep it out of the hands of the French, the Dutch Republic finished the demolition job themselves, leaving the castle in about the same condition seen today.Underneath the Kasteelruine is a series of tunnels, corridors and passageways dating back to the earliest fortification of the hill. Known as the Velvet Cave (Fluweelengrot in Dutch), it was started by masons and miners cutting out blocks of marlstone for constructing the castle and other buildings in Valkenburg. Over time the labyrinth grew, with tunnels used as secret passages for the castle up above. Serving as both hiding places and escape routes during various attacks and occupations, many of the tunnels weren’t discovered until 1937. In 1944 the Velvet Cave served as a refuge to hundreds of citizens of Valkenburg during World War II, as American troops dislodged German occupiers from the region. These American soldiers etched their names, hometowns and doodles on the soft walls of the cave, still visible today.Also adorning the walls of the cave are drawings and carvings, many of them celebrating old legends and stories of Valkenburg and Limburg, evoking long-forgotten secrets that naturally haunt a ruined castle built atop a maze of secret passages.',\n",

And, perhaps most oddly, there’s a merchant ship parked atop its lake.The quirky architecture belongs to Ida Grove, Iowa, a rural town with a population of just over 2,100 people. It’s the work of Byron LeRoy Godberson, a local farm boy who became rich after founding a company called Midwest Industries.Godberson clearly loved castles. Under his instruction, the buildings built for his company took the shape of the medieval-style structures that look as though they’d be better suited for 12th-century Europe.His vision left Ida Grove with an assortment of unusual structures. Its shopping plaza, newspaper, and skating rink all look like castles. There’s even a medieval drawbridge over one of the creeks. Though Godberson has since passed away, his legacy remains cemented in his unusual creations.In addition to all the castles, Godberson also oversaw the construction of an eight-acre artificial lake, which he named after his wife LaJune.

Born in the Castle Frankenstein (German: BurgFrankenstein) in 1673, it’s disputed whether or not he was the inspiration for Mary Shelley’s mad scientist of the same name, who did some cadaver experiments of his own.What is sure about Dippel is his colorful career as an alchemist. He attached his name to Dippel’s Animal Oil, which he discovered from the destructive distillation of animal parts and claimed as a universal medicine. The animal oil came at the end of a wave of popularity for Iatrochemistry, which had moved alchemy from the search for creating gold to finding new medicines. The unpleasant taste and smell, as well as the progression of medicine, made Dippel’s oil fall into disrepute by the end of the 18th-century.Dippel later helped set up a laboratory in Berlin for making gold and, at one point, he ended up in prison on a Danish island for seven years due to political activities. In 1734, he finally had a stroke and died at Castle Wittgenstein near Berleburg, although his friends claimed he was poisoned. By his own hand or that of another, it is unclear.The Castle Frankenstein is now in ruins, with only two towers, a restaurant with a vegan and kid-friendly menu, and a chapel remaining. However, the perhaps mythical connection to Mary Shelley’s novel “Frankenstein” keeps it a popular destination, especially for Halloween. In late October and early November, theBurg Frankenstein Halloween party gathers zombies, witches, werewolves, vampires, and regular visitors for scary dinners and creepy shows.A popular annual party was started there by American soldiers stationed near the castle in World War II.

To this end Snyder purchased 5,000 acres of land, including his very own lake, and began work on the evocative mansion in 1905.

After completing construction, one of Snyder’s sons took up residence in the huge castle until the family’s money ran out due to land rights lawsuits surrounding the castle’s property. After Snyder the younger’s depression and poverty drove him from the house the building was opened as a hotel and lodge until 1942 when the entire building was utterly destroyed by a fire.The state purchased the property in the 1970’s and has worked to preserve the crumbled walls of Snyder’s dream home as a feature in their state park.

While the lodges that were originally built in the area were of modest, rustic proportions, portions of the land were eventually purchased by Phoebe Hearst (mother of William) who changed all of that. The elder Hearst built a massive European-styled castle on her portion of the land in direct opposition to the deal she had worked out with the original owners.When she died, Phoebe willed massive land holdings to her son William, but Wyntoon was left to his cousin Anne Flint, much to the chagrin of William himself. Never one to not get what he wanted, Hearst withheld valuable artworks from his cousin in an effort to get ahold of the estate, and eventually reached an acrimonious settlement where he bought the land from the embittered woman.A few years after acquiring the land, Phoebe Hearst’s castle burnt to the ground thanks to a kitchen fire. Undeterred, Hearst decided to build a bigger castle using historic materials taken right from Europe to give it a medieval feel. The publishing magnate had men dismantle and ship a 700-year-old monastery from Spain despite having no legal grounds to do so. He also had the remnants of an ancient barn he had previously acquired brought to the site. Realizing that his original castle plan would not work, Hearst shifted his vision to the construction of a Bavarian-style village comprised of a number of smaller structures. Thus quaint (by Hearst standards) cottages were built with names such as The Cinderella House and The Fairy House, each one invoking traditional “black forest” fairytales.Today the strange village still stands and remains the private property of the Hearst Corporation.

The circular red sandstone defense was finished in 1811, a cousin to the better-known Castle Clinton at Battery Park just across the channel. The eight-foot-thick walls of the “castle” were arranged in a circular arch so that the 100 cannons installed within could fire in just about every direction.The defense was fearsome enough that it never even had to be tested. The British never attacked New York during the War of 1812. The fort remained and acted as a Union barracks and jail during the Civil War, before being converted to a full military prison later on. The castle operated as a prison of some sort until 1965, when the aging structure was finally decommissioned.Today Castle Williams is restored and protected as a historical landmark on Governors Island.

The village, in the La Pera municipality of the Baix Empordà region, is sleepy and picturesque. The castle itself, perhaps as old as the eleventh century, is austere, built to defend against rival barons, Muslim armies, and time. This, no doubt, cracked Salvador Dalí up.Two-parts mad genius and one-part just mad, Dalí is best known as the mustachioed face of Surrealism—the artistic attempt to produce the unconscious, visibly, with words and dream-inspired pictures—and as one of the most talented and most insistently weird painters of the twentieth century.His other eccentricities aside (he was a pacifist but supported Franco; he made a movie involving cut-up human eyes and giant eggs filled with mustard), Dalí was madly in love with his wife, Gala. They bought and restored the half-ruined castle of Púbol after their secretary and collaborator, Enric Sabater, photographed it from the air in 1969.Dalí immediately went to work making his castle—intended to be Gala’s “refuge” from the world—strange. He placed sculptures of his trademark spindly-legged elephants in the garden and busts of Richard Wagner around the swimming pool. He built Gala a throne and dais. He painted her as an angel. He filled the house with priceless art and homages to art.Perhaps best of all, Dalí put the castle’s radiators behind steel screens, disguising them beautifully—only to then paint beautiful trompe l’oeil radiators over the screens.In 1982, Gala passed away in Portlligat, and her body was immediately brought to the castle. (Dalí had the doctors fake the place of death to avoid paperwork.) Gala was buried in a red Dior dress in the cellar, and the castle became Dalí’s final workshop.Curiously, Dalí isn’t buried at Púbol. After being badly burned in a fire at the castle, he moved back to Figueres, 25 miles away, where he died in 1989 of heart failure. There he lies buried at one of his other museums (he has three in Spain), the Theatre Museum in Figueres.The castle at Púbol has been open to the public since 1996.',\n",

       "  'Kelburn Castle in Scotland is a stately home whose original structure likely dates from before the 13th century. It’s thought to be one of the oldest castles in the country to have been continuously occupied by the same family, the other being Dunvegan Castle. Norman Keep, which was built primarily for defense rather than comfort, is now enclosed within a larger home that was completed around 1581.But its history isn’t what makes this castle stand out. In June 2007, after learning the entire concrete facing would need to be replaced, the building’s open-minded owners invited Brazilian graffiti artists to paint a large section of the castle’s outer walls.Painted by artists Nina, Nunca, and the duo Os Gemeos (“The Twins”—which the two artists, in fact, are), the contrast between the 16th-century building in the woods of Scotland and the 21st-century urban Brazilian graffiti creates an eccentric and delightful visual landscape.In addition to the castle itself, Kelburn Estate has a number of interesting natural features including waterfalls. Since David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow, was the Governor of New Zealand between 1892-97, a small museum was built on the estate to house a collection of artifacts related to both the Pacific island nation and the local culture. It includes farming equipment native to Ayrshire alongside Māori spears, taxidermied Polynesian birds, and kauri gum. In 2009 the castle suffered from a fire but sustained only minor damage.',\n",

       "  'Squire’s Castle in the Chagrin Valley of Cleveland is a misnomer—it isn’t actually a castle, but rather the gatehouse to a castle that was never built. There are two versions of why this castle never materialized.In the late-19thcentury, Feargus B. Squire purchased 525 acres in the scenic Chagrin Valley. The English-born Squire started his career as an office boy at an oil company and eventually became the vice president of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Squire commissioned a New York-based architect and intended to build two massive, ornate European-style mansions on the Willoughby Hills site. The first (and only) building to be built was the gatehouse, which had three floors, a basement, and even a room for Squire’s exotic hunting trophies. The urban myth version of why the rest of the castle was constructed involves Squire’s wife Rebecca. She was thought to be unhappy in this country residence and prone to insomnia and nightly walks. On one night, she noticed strange movement in the trophy room and in her fear, fell down the stairs and broke her neck. Her death devastated her husband and he never returned to the castle and later sold it. The likely actualseries of events is slightly different. Squire lost interest in the property and instead constructed a mansion in Wickliffe, where he later became mayor. His wife died under normal circumstances and not in the castle. The property was sold in 1922, but the gatehouse was abandoned and later taken over by Cleveland Metroparks. Given the extent of vandalism that had taken place, they decided to remove all the structures inside the building.Today all that remains of Squire’s brief stay in the would-be castle is the exterior shell—that, and the occasional ghost stories of Mrs. Squire. People have reported seeing a red lantern light and a female figure near the property.',\n",

It became a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.”Called Castle Hill, the area is a high country station—a station is a large farm area dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle—on New Zealand’s South Island. Looking like the ruins of a castle, and hence the name, the hill is a popular climbing and bouldering spot for rock climbers.But rock climbers aren’t the only ones impressed by the site. In 2002, the Dalai Lama visited the South Island. Apparently, he didn’t like the energy in the nearby town of Christchurch (whose church is made from rock quarried from the boulders) and he was taken to the boulder field. He was so taken by the landscape, and his spiritual experience there he named the area a “Spiritual Center of the Universe.”The area got some world exposure when the nearby Flock Hill station was used for the filming of the climactic battle scenes of the 2005 movie The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.',\n",

       "  'Since it was completed in the early 13th century, the Holyrood Abbey Church has acted as a fulcrum for major events in Scottish and English history. Tracing the history of the church tells the story of Scotland’s relationship with its neighbors to the south, and its ruined state neatly summarizes the results of English colonization in the British Isles.The abbey’s name refers toKing David’s experience with a charging deer and the shining holy cross that appeared in the forest to save his life. Rood is an Old English name for a crucifix. Founded by the king in the 12th century,the church was a grand structure with huge sweeping towers and a massive nave. Since it was near Edinburgh Castle, kings regularly stayed at the abbey and worshipped in the church, but its period of regular use was slowly coming to an end.In 1544, recurring war and invasion from England began to take a toll on the church as structural damage occurred during the War of Rough Wooing. Only ten years later, parts of the church were deemed unnecessary and were also removed. Although the Abbey was remodeled in 1633, its improvement did not last long.During the glorious revolution, English forces once again struck a deadly blow as a mob looted the church and destroyed the roof in 1688. At this point, Holyrood had nearly taken on the form it has now. An attempt to replace the roof was shoddily made in 1768 and the new roof fell in on itself within a decade. Today, the Abbey Church stands as it has for the last 250 years as ruins next to the palace in the middle of Scotland’s capital city, Edinburgh.The ruins of the Abbey Chapel are said to have inspired Felix Mendelssohn to write his “Scottish Symphony” after a visit in July 1829. Queen Victoria and her uncle King Edward IV have been sited as using these dilapidated ruins as a model for their artistic endeavors.',\n",

       "  'Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland, Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom and numerous other magical castles were all inspired by a real castle: Neuschwanstein Castle,the awe-inspiring retreat of the “fairy-tale king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria. Commissioned by the king in homage to Richard Wagner, the fantastical castle was designed by theatrical set designer Christian Jank. The beautiful design was to further enhance the already romantic mountain and forest scenery.The first stone of Neuschwanstein Castle (which literally means, “New Swan Stone palace”) was laid in September 1869. The technology used to build this castle was considered modern and advanced. New inventions such as electricity, plumbing, heat and steamboats were used in the construction of the castle, and Ludwig himself was considered responsible for the introduction of many of these inventions to the area.In 1886, as the massively expensive castle neared completion, the State Commissioner pronounced Ludwig insane and arrested him soon after. The day after he was arrested, Ludwig requested the Commissioner go on a walk in the woods with him. The commissioner agreed and told his guards to stay behind. Both were found mysteriously dead in a lake later that evening. Ludwig was never able to see the finalized castle—and it didn’t receive its name until after his death—but his taste for elegant, and extravagant, design resonates throughout the interior of the Romanesque-style castle. After his death, the castle was opened for the public to help pay off the expenses.During World War II, the castle was appropriated and used by German forces as a depot to store all of the plundered art from France and other Nazi-occupied countries in Europe. At the close of the war, the Nazis contemplated blowing the castle up with explosives to prevent the encroaching allied forces from discovering the scale of their art looting.However, fortunately, the plan was never implemented. Today, the castle is one of the biggest attractions in Bavaria and manages to draw well over a million people a year.Of particular delight is the Grotto Room, an artificial cave complete with stalactites and a waterfall; it was intended to represent a cave from Wagner’s opera “Tannhauser.” Ironically, Wagner never stepped foot in the castle.',\n",

       "  'Edinburgh’s famed culinary destination delights contemporary patrons with fine Scottish cuisine and luxe, broody atmosphere. But rewind four centuries, and residents of this old-world landmark lived only a stone’s throw away from the convicted witches burned to death on nearby Castlehill. Nestled in Boswell’s Court amid a cluster of historic buildings at the gates of Edinburgh Castle, The Witchery is housed in a former abode built for merchant Thomas Lowthian in 1595. Visitors can still make out his initials and his motto, “O Lord in thee is all my traist,” at the door.Boswell’s Court is named after a previous resident, John Boswell, the uncle of James Boswell. James was known for being the biographer of Doctor Samuel Johnson, not to mention a clue in crossword puzzles. Johnson was a famous English poet and playwright, as well as the writer of the first comprehensive English Dictionary . The two are reported to have dined together at this location towards the end of the 18th century.Following Lowthian’s residence at Boswell’s Court, the building served as a committee chamber for clergy members of the Church of Scotland and later, a rectory; but it’s The Witchery’s proximity to Castlehill, where hundreds were burned at the stake, that renders this gastronomic sensation a beguiling (if sinister) linchpin of the Edinburgh experience. It’s believed that some 4,000 accused witches were executed across Scotland between the late 16th century and the 1720s. This aggressive and ruthless witch hunt was most notably helmed by Mary Queen of Scots’ son King James VI of Scotland (and I of England) in the nation’s capital during his reign from 1603 until his death in 1625. James forged the only royal thesis condemning witchcraft titled Daemonologie, by which the hysteria over this “high treason against God” went mainstream and resulted in what historians believe was the highest concentration of witchcraft-related executions in the country.Named in memoriam of the innumerable accused, The Witchery was opened as a high-end eatery and inn by restaurateur/hotelier James Thomson OBE in 1979, thus breathing new life and theatrical flair into Boswell’s Court. Magnificent tapestries, paneled walls of 17th-century oak taken from the neighboring St. Giles Cathedral, and gilded accouterments adorn The Witchery’s lush Jacobean interior. The award-winning Secret Garden, The Witchery’s al-fresco component added on in 1990, provides a light and airy balance in juxtaposition to the rich opulence of the main dining space with a painted ceiling a la Rossend Castle in Fife, and a quartet of floor-to-ceiling French doors. Guests may also book one of nine theatrical hotel suites located just above The Witchery for an extended stay at one of Edinburgh’s most enchanting points of interest.',\n",

The castle itself is a marvel, a well-maintained fortification originally built in the 11th century in a rare circular style.The most unique feature of Restormel Castle is the way the chambers, including the kitchens, Great Hall, and guest rooms, are all arranged against the outer circular walls. (The exceptions are the gatehouse, which has an attached drawbridge over the ditch that surrounds the castle, and the chapel.) The grandeur of the design can be seen in the large windows and fireplaces and in the grand Great Hall.These ruins were once a luxurious residence for the Earl of Cornwalland one of the four chief Norman castles of Cornwall. The early history of Restormel is shrouded in mystery. Some researchers believe it could have been the first castle built by the Norman conquerors. The original castle was likely built in the late 11th century by Baldwin Fitz Turstin, and the stone keep was possibly built by King Edmund in the 13th century.After the Earl of Cornwall, Edmund II, died in 1299, the Earldom of Cornwall reverted to the crown; Restormel lost its importance and was left to decay. In 1337, the castle passed into the hands of the first Duke of Cornwall - Edward, The Black Prince, son of Edward III. One of its chief attractions at the time was the large deer park that surrounded it, teeming with game. After Edward died in 1376, the castle again fell into disrepair. It was briefly reoccupied and fought over during theEnglish Civil War in the mid 17th century, and then abandoned once again.Since 1925 Restormel has been officially owned by the Duchy of Cornwall and cared for by English Heritage. Itis the best remaining example of a circular castle anywhere in the United Kingdom.It is also a delightful spot for an outing like a picnic or hike. Perched atop a mound in one of the most historic and picturesque parts of the country, the estate commands a magnificent 360-degree view and is surrounded by woodlands that are a haven for birds and wildlife. Primroses, bluebells, and daffodils cover the mound in spring, while rhododendrons flower in summer.',\n",

Carved into a massive boulder, Qasr al-Farid, or “The Lonely Castle,” is a stunning ancient structure that rivals the majesty of any carved architecture in the world.Created around the 1st century CE, the tall facade was never actually finished. The description of the site as a “castle” is misleading, as the grand carving is actually a tomb that was built as part of the ancient Nabatean site of Hegra. The Nabateans had a unique construction technique that saw their tombs being chiseled right out of the rock from the top down. Such is the case with Qasr al-Farid, although the monument appears to never have been completed, so the craftsmanship and precision of work slowly deteriorate closer to the base of the structure.Generally speaking, this may be seen as a strike against the site in terms of its beauty or its archeological importance, but the tapering finish on the facade has actually turned out to be a boon. The incomplete portion of the tomb is a terrific window into the steps taken by the ancient carvers before the rougher work was polished away.Archeological importance aside, The Lonely Castle stands out as a starkly unforgettable wonder in a region that is crowded with them.

At the time of the eruption, there was likely a small body of water at the site that filled with lava, creating unique features once the excess magma flowed away, leaving the bleak geology behind. One of the most impressive features is a naturally formed rock arch known as “The Church.”The name Dimmuborgir translates to “Dark Castles,” or “Dark Cities,” and the ominous name is a fitting monicker not only thanks to the eerie rock formations but also thanks to the creepy folklore associated with the site. Dimmuborgir has often been associated with hell, oftenas a gate to the nether realms. As Christianity came to the country the site was said to be where Satan landed when after being tossed out of Heaven.

The tall towers of the castle sit atop a massive rock located on what was once the border between Christian and Muslim territories.

Acquiring land and power, Erazem had become a well-known robber baron in the region. However, he quickly grew too big for his britches, murdering the kinsman of Frederick III, the Holy Roman Emperor. With the strength of all of his forces, Frederick came after Lueger, and forced him into hiding in his castle.Despite the Emperor’s superior forces, the rebellious Lueger had both brains and a secret tunnel between the castle and the nearby Postojna Cave.

       "  'On the morning of March 16th, 1244 over 200 Cathars, led by their bishop, Bertrand Marty, walked out of the Montségur fortified village and proceeded down the pog (from the Occitan “puòg” meaning promontory, hilltop) to a field where a huge bonfire was readied for them. All walked voluntarily into the flames, no stakes were required. Today a stone stele marks the spot where the sad scene is reputed to have taken place.Although the ruins that can be seen today at the top of the pog are not those of the Cathar fortress, but of a 17th century French defensive castle (although it is said that its stones were taken from the rubble of the previous construction), the site nonetheless has a sort of mystical aura; one can’t help but feel a connection with those who lived and perished there.The history of the Cathars runs deep all over southern France but Montségur holds a special place. The small fortress was a safe haven for the Cathars, and was considered the Church’s seat and head. Catharism was a Christian religious movement that thrived in the south of what is today France (and other places in southern Europe) in the 12th to the 14th centuries. Initially the Catholic Church attempted to end the movement using missionaries but the murder of papal legate Pierre de Castelnau in 1208 made Pope Innocent III choose a more coercive approach, instigating what was to become the Albigensian Crusade, a 20-year campaign against the Cathars. Although successful in bringing the county of Toulouse, whose count was perceived to be a supporter of the “heretics,” under the French crown, it did not succeed in eradicating Catharism. After the Crusade per se, an inquisition was called to bring an end to the movement. This culminated in the 10-month long siege of Montségur.There is a persistent legend which talks of a mysterious and invaluable treasure being kept at Montségur and that, in the days prior to its surrender, it was taken away from the site by four Cathars in the last days of the occupation. What was that treasure? One theory suggests that it was the Holy Grail itself, as Montségur is believed to be the “Holy Grail castle” mentioned in Esschenback’s Parzival. Some consider that it was the grail which was taken from Montségur, brought to Rennes-Le-Chateau, and hidden there.Grail site or no, there is assuredly something captivating about the small castle, making a worthwhile visit when in southwestern France. Getting to Montségur requires a drive along a winding road in the Pyrenees foothills ending with an incredible view of the castle. Then, a hike up to the castle from the stele along a steep trail, possibly used by the Cathars themselves to meet their faith, provides a sense of the harshness of life on a hilltop.',\n",

Among them was railroad baron Stephen Salisbury II with whom Bancroft had shared a childhood. After Bancroft’s death, Salisbury’s son used $15,000 of his family’s money to build Bancroft Tower in honor of his father’s boyhood chum. The thin castle stands 56 feet tall, made of cobblestones and large rocks it contains a number of empty rooms and seems to have always been more decorative than utilitarian. While Bancroft was a Worcester native, the medieval monument was a strange choice for the Naval man, and it has been speculated that Salisbury III was simply trying to use up the family fortune.No matter the intent, Bancroft Tower still stands today although the interior is gated off. The tower is typically only open to the public on Sundays in the month of October. Truly, no one is quite sure what to make of this castle. ',\n",

With 13th century origins as a medieval fortress belonging to the Napier family (to which the inventor of the logarithm, John Napier, belonged) Lauriston Castle is an extensively altered 16th-century manor house boasting idyllic grounds overlooking the Firth estuary. The house passed through several families over the centuries, ending with the Reids in 1903.Born into respectively successful Edinburgh families, William Reid and his wife were the final residents of Lauriston Castle. When they moved from 78 George Street in Edinburgh, they brought with them a number of the objects that still adorn the castle’s interior today—including pieces of British furniture, Chinese porcelain, Dutch ceramics, an extensive collection of Blue John objects, and mezzotint engravings. The transition prompted their foray into collecting European furniture, oriental rugs, and other coveted decorative items that were popular in the day. Highlights of the Lauriston Castle collection include a Scottish Lady’s writing desk constructed circa 1800, a late 18th-century French commode, William Reid’s exceptional collection of 18th-century Italian furniture, and a late 16th-century pietra dura tabletop boasting marble and magnificent semi-precious stones.William Reid was the owner of Morison & Company, one of the nation’s most respected fabrication businesses; while his wife’s brother, William Barton, helmed a sanitary engineering company that dealt with plumbing, electrical work, and hospital sterilization. The brothers-in-law worked side by side given their complementary trades, and together they installed much of the “modern” cabinetry and interior décor in Lauriston Castle—not to mention the building’s plumbing, lighting, and heating.In addition to the Reids’ notable collection of furniture and decorative objects, the museum exhibits a number of fascinating personal items from their daily lives like a newspaper clipping reporting the Titanic disaster, a telephone from the 1920s, Mr. Reid’s piano and sheet music, and Mrs. Reid’s walking stick.

Rising up out of a weather-worn stone spire, the beacon looks like something straight out of a fantasy novel.The lighthouse was first built in 1897 just off shore from a castle in Andros. The stone column on which it was built had been shaped by millennia of natural erosion into the perfect pedestal for a coastal beacon. Unfortunately the original lighthouse was not long for this world, and was destroyed during World War II. For a time, the rocky outcropping went without a proper lighthouse, and the fantastical image created by the former structure was all but lost.However, the lovely beacon apparently had an extra life. The lighthouse was eventually rebuilt in the early 1990s by an oil tycoon who dedicated the structure to his daughter. The replica became Greece’s first automated lighthouse, eliminating the need for an onsite keeper to operate the light. But even with the modern upgrade, the lighthouse still looks like something out of Dungeon and Dragons, with the winding staircase hewn from the rock itself, leading up to the door of the tower.Since its renovation, ithas become one of the area’s foremost tourist attractions, drawing lighthouse peepers and photographers who come to gawk at its singular beauty.

Located in the English county of Northumberland, today it is home to the Duke of Northumberland and his family and is the second largest inhabited castle in England after Windsor Castle.Like many centuries-old estates, it has been besieged and renovated a number of times and home to a number of noble lords, most notably the Percy family, a powerful house in northern England for 700 years starting in the Middle Ages.The most famous of the Percys is Harry “Hotspur” Percy, a statue of whom is in one of the courtyards at Alnwick Castle. He was given the nickname after fighting courageously and impetuously against the Scots, and his story was immortalized by Shakespeare’s Henry IV.While part of the castle is today occupied by the duke, the rest is open to the public in the summertime, where you can learn more about its medieval history, take broomstick lessons, catch an outdoor moving screening, and more.',\n",

       "  'This foreboding 13th-century tower is the sole surviving relic of the medieval castle of Rouen,built by King Phillip II of France after his victory over the English. The castle played an important part in the Hundred Years’ War and the religious wars between French Catholics and Huguenot Protestants, but its most infamous role was as the place where Joan of Arc was imprisoned and interrogated before being burned at the stake in 1431.The “Maid of Orléans,” as the French heroine was known, had been captured by theEnglish at the Siege of Compiègne, her final battle. She was jailed atBeaurevoir Castle where she tried to escape several times, almost succeeding on one occasion, and so was moved to the castle at Rouen, which was considered escape-proof. French forces attacked the city several times in the months that followed in a desperate attempt to rescue her, but each time theywere forced to withdraw.Joan was put on trial for heresy by an English kangaroo court and subjected to torture. The chronicles say that when the interrogators at the castle showed her their instruments of torture, hoping perhaps to break her spirit and obtain a confession without having to use them, she stared them down fearlessly and replied with tremendous and characteristic bravery,“Truly, if you have to pull my members and my soul from my body, I shall say nothing else; and if I say something to you, I would always say to you afterwards that you made me say it by force.”After several public interrogations designed to break down her will,Joan was forced to sign a document to renounce her beliefs and to stop wearing the clothing of a soldier. But when guards removed her woman’s clothing, she was forced to wear men’s clothes and sentenced to death for it. She was burned at the stake as a heretic in the center of the city.Although the English and Burgundians may have achieved their goal of humiliating the French in the short term, in the long term they were to fail spectacularly. In the centuries to come Joan of Arc became not only a saint but a beloved and immortalized historicalfigure.The castle itself was largely destroyed in the 16th century, yet the tower where this remarkable leader once faced her persecutors still remains standing. The tower was left derelict for many hundreds of yearsbut was restored, and today is open to the public as a museum.',\n",

It was not until later on in the 13th century that the tower was expanded upon, creating a more traditional castle-like structure. This final expansion of the site was carried out by the final couple of Counts of Esch, who gave the town (and its castle), their name.The village around the castle also grew steadily alongside its proud central tower. With advances in warfare, the town eventually built a wall around the entirety ofEsch-sur-Sûre, adding a couple of smaller lookout towers that accented the more ancient one. However by the 1700s, the castle had fallen to the common folk of the village, many of whom moved into the ancient site. Villagers were still known to be living in the castle at least up until the late 1800’s.Today the castle continues to stand proudly above the town ofEsch-sur-Sûre, even though it is in ruins.

A mysterious, fanciful structure that tops a knoll in the Airport Gateway District of Phoenix looks like the work of at least two out of three.Italian immigrant Alessio Carraro dreamed of building a resort hotel as the centerpiece of his high-end subdivision, Carrarro Heights. He and his son constructed the hotel over just fourteen months, between 1928 and 1930. The building was a thing of beauty, based on Italian architecture and tiered like a wedding cake.However, perhaps because of the stench from the nearby Tovrea meatpacking stockyards, or because of the Great Depression, it never opened. Carraro sold his castle and its 42 acres to Edward Ambrose Tovrea, magnate of the stockyards, who transformed the massive hotel into a private residence. Tovrea died after less than a year living in the castle, and is memorialized by a giant steel pyramid on the property. His widow Della lived there until her death in 1969.Over the years Tovrea Castle developed an air of mystery. As Phoenix grew outward and the land surrounding the castle developed into a metropolitan area, the isolated mansionand its acres of desert attracted a lot of attention. After Della’s death, the land (which had fallen into ruin) was purchased by the City of Phoenix.

       "  'Despite its long history and six-story stone tower, most residents of San Francisco, even those that pass by it daily, have no idea that Albion Castle exists.Built in 1870 by John Hamlin Burnell, a young English immigrant with plans for a brewery to supply the over 800 saloons serving the growing city. Beer was already a popular choice in San Francisco, with several local breweries already competing for business. But Burnell’s new property had a secret advantage: An underground aquifer that provided pure cold water, perfect for brewing - not to mention free. He built himself not only the workspaces for the Albion Porter & Ale Brewery, but also a castle home. Although relatively petite and built into a hillside, it features a distinctive tower built from stones pulled from cargo ship’s ballast, modeled after Norman fortifications Burnell loved back home.Under the castle, Burnell dug out two stone cisterns, each capturing 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of spring water per day. The 200-foot pools are accessed by a cave entrance, and still provide fresh clean water today.Burnell built his unusual brewery on land on the outskirts of the city then managed by the Hunter brothers. Now known as Hunter’s Point, it was the site of a huge Naval shipbuilding yard for decades, now a rough-edged neighborhood. The property has changed hands many times, and had several incarnations over the years.After the 18th amendment (Prohibition) forced the brewery to close down in 1919, the property was reborn as the Albion Water Company, providing bottled drinking water from the underground cisterns from 1928 to 1947. In 1938, the castle was bought by the sculptor Adrian Voisin who remodeled the living area, adding much of the woodwork and medieval-inspired interior that is there today. He lived and worked there for some twenty years.In 1961 the castle was nearly the victim of a highway construction scheme that planned to bulldoze the building, but it was saved based on the argument that the fresh water source under the building “could be the only non-contaminated source of fresh water in the event of a nuclear attack.” (According to the San Francisco Chronicle at the time)Over the years, the nearby Naval shipyards complained about the inconvenient proximity of a fresh water source so close to their highly hazardous undertakings.In 1998 the property was sold to another artist, this time sculptor Eric Higgs, also known as one of the founders of CitySearch. Until 2005 the castle was used as a residence, art studio, and occasional party location, then it was sold at auction for $2.1 million dollars. The purchasers, local brewers and castle fanciers from Napa county, intended to revitalize the space and re-launch the historic Albion Brewery. Although some renovations to the property and interior were made, the brewery never materialized.In 2012, the castle was purchased by former San Francisco Police lieutenant and real estate investor Bill Gilbert. The structure is currently being rented for small select events, however, plans are underway to bring back the water bottling business to utilize the natural, fresh spring water from the cisterns initiated by the founder.',\n",

It was not until his descendant Frederick William II came around in the late 18th century and turned the island into a private getaway for he and his favorite mistress, Wilhelmine Enke.

The two towers are connected by a medieval-styled bridge.After William II died, his son took over the island and built, among other buildings, a menagerie that had all manner of exotic animals including crocodiles, wolves, eagles, and of course peacocks. By the mid-1940s most of the animals had been transferred to the newly built Berlin Zoo.

It opened in 1849, and the solid span of wrought iron and stone connected Buda and Pest, the two sides of the capital city.At the top of the hill, rising over 300feet at an almost 40-degree incline, is Buda Castle—with no easy way, at the time, to get there from the bridge. That changed 21years later with the opening of the Budavári Sikló, Europe’s second funicular railway. For the next 70-odd years the stepped cars took passengers up and down the equivalent of 30flights of stairs. Those trips ended during World War II, when the line was destroyed during the bombing of Budapest.Funiculars, also called incline or cable railways, go back hundreds of years. They use a fairly simple pulley system, harnessing the cars’ own counterweight to scoot up and down steep grades like Castle Hill. Without the Budavári Sikló to handle the job, access to Buda Castle meant taking the circuitous route of an autobus. Or worse, walking. Luckily pieces of the funicular had been salvaged after the bombing. It took a long time, but in 1986 the little-railway-that-could reopened along its original track, with most of its original design. It’s now operated by Budapest Public Transport, serving both head-down commuters and eyes-up tourists.

Or at least that’s what generations of Clevelanders would tell you.The High Victorian home has been a fixture of the city’s west side for over a hundred years. It was built in the 1880s by grocer-turned-banker Hannes Tiedemann. Although his wealth was significant, Tiedemann’s life was marred by tragedy. A distressing number of his immediate family members would die in this house, including his 15-year-old daughter, his mother, and three additional children, who died in infancy. The story goes that the construction of the castle’s elaborate turrets, prominent gargoyles, and increasingly large network of rooms were an attempt to distract his wife from the ceaseless barrage of death. That is, until she too suddenly passed away. After Tiedemann sold the property, it spent several decades as a German cultural center. The tales of haunting picked up in the 1960s, as reports of surging electricity, the sound of babies crying, and a mysterious woman in black gained steam. Human bones were found in a closet in 1975, but the leading theory there is that they were planted by the new owner, who was looking to put the place on the map. (He started offering ghost tours of the property soon after.) As the years have gone by, tales of Franklin Castle have grown more numerous and fantastical, and now include an axe murder, a mass shooting of Nazis in the basement, and the alleged hanging death of Heidemann’s illegitimate daughter. Many stories focus on heinous acts that supposedly took place in tunnels below the house, which seem unlikely as there are, in fact, no tunnels under the house. Franklin Castle has changed owners many times in recent years, including a stint as the home of Michael DeVinko, known better under his stage name Mickey Deans and as the last husband of actress Judy Garland. After a fire, it laid abandoned for several years, before the current owners purchased the place in 2011. ',\n",

Construction of the current castle began in 1850 at the behest of Count Cesare Mattei, a slightly unhinged, self-taught medicine man and politician who had developed his own system of healing that he said harnessed the life energy (electricity) of plants to heal all of Man’s ills, including cancer. Envisioning his castle as the home of his medical revolution, Mattei constructed the “Rocchetta,” as he called it, with the enthusiasm and focus of a child.Mixing medieval, Middle-Eastern, and gothic styles just to name a few, Mattei simply seemed to create the rooms as the whims came to him. The layout of the castle is no better, seemingly like a veritable labyrinth of arbitrarily interconnected rooms. Many of the features were also built from faked or disguised materials such as painted “stained glass.” The rooms each seemed to serve their own strange purpose as well most notably the “Nineties Room” which Mattei specifically built to host a banquet that would occur on the occasion of his 90th birthday, celebrating he and his nonagenarian compatriots.Unfortunately Mattei would never get to host such a party, passing away at the age of 87. After his death the castle changed hands a number of times, and was even once donated to the City of Bologna who declined the bizarre gift. By the 1980s the castle was completely abandoned and falling into disrepair. However an independent conservation group took control of the site in the 2000s and began repairing the site, opening some of it to the public.Mattei’s electrohomeopathy is still practiced in some corners of the world such as India and Pakistan, but the true testament to Mattei’s genius/madness may be his beloved Rocchetta.
